I had a youtube channel of 6 years that I was working on and have used the same name of the channel for all 6 years. 2 years ago someone else came by and trademarked the EXACT name I was using. He sat on it and waited until we had our first successful year with some growth then he filed for trademark infringement on our year in review video. I googled around called lawyers and got advice from them. Everyone basically said that the USA is a first to use country meaning simply because he trademarked the name I still have protection because I used it before him in the same format. Meanwhile I communicated with this guy trying to work something out and he said he would get back to me in a couple of days so we can work something out. But a couple of days is the window youtube gave for us to work something out so he just waited out the youtube system and youtube immediately TERMINATED my account. Not tell me to change the name or take the custom url, simply erased from existence. So from that time I sent in an appeal to them explaining the situation. A couple of weeks go by no response. Tweet to @teamyoutube and tell them I sent an appeal with no answer. ""We've forwarded that to our team and will get back to you with any updates"". Wait a couple more weeks still nothing. Tweet again ""We've forwarded that to our team and will get back to you with any updates. We appreciate your patience. Tweet them a couple more times, get ignored. A month and a half goes by, I send another appeal and tweet STILL nothing. So now I say fuck it get a lawyer so I can cancel the guys trademark and get my channel back.Hire lawyer they say it should be a simple slam dunk especially if he's not even using it. File the petition to cancel. Hear from the guy who owns the trademark trying to compromise with me because this could cost both of us $20,000. Tell him I'm not interested in anything he is offering we either let it go through the legal process or I pay him to relinquish the trademark. A week later he decides to voluntarily relinquish the trademark.So where am I at now? His trademark is canceled, @teamyoutube doesn't respond to ANY of my tweets about my appeal. Sent a third appeal in with no response and have spent about 3 grand on the whole legal process. How do I go about getting my channel back? It's not trademark infringing (it never was), youtube has no point of contact to explain this and I'm out of options.TLDR; Youtube wrongfully terminated my account because someone trademarked my channel name. Hired lawyer to cancel guys trademark, guy decides to let me pay him to hand it over. Trademark is officially canceled.

I witnessed it myself some time ago, on a YouTuber's F.A.Q. video. I commented with my own question, and I've suddenly seen it becoming a generic joke. I panicked out and quit the video and reentered it again, the comment was still the same. So I've relaunched YouTube (I was on my phone) to see the video again, and my comment was back to normal. Yet it happened again on a discussion I was having, but from the side of the person I was talking with - I saw the reply as a normal answer to my statement in the notification, then when I loaded the video, it became generic and unrelated. I ended up reloading the video, and the reply went back to being the one I've originally seen on the notification.

The situation was as follows: We were pushing 5 different streams (different languages) to Wowza cloud which was distributing to various destinations including Youtube. One point to note is our wowza settings were going to Akamai first so we could use Primary/Backup ingest setup (we came to later know that this ""route"" ads an extra step in the delivery that can cause latency/buffering). On one system (Imac 2017), the destination was our main Youtube channel, for a few hours things were generally OK, however at one point during the event we reached appx 60K concurrent viewers. This is the time when we started seeing from our side and viewers side lots of buffering. Unfortunately, at the exact same time, Youtube was giving us an internal 500 server error, which prohibited us from viewing our dashboard and stream health, but we did notice our Wowza stream health had lots of incoming/outgoing datarate fluctuations. The buffering issue wasnt the case on the other channels that we were streaming to. Because the buffering was so bad, we were constantly switching on/off our wirecast feed to resume the stream, where it would switch between Akamai's Primary and Backup. Strangely, once the archive video was processed, we didnt see much issue except for this switching between Primary & Backup. Once the concurrent views dropped back to appx. 5K, things again settled back down and we didnt have any more issues.So, we're wanting to understand a few things:* What could have been the root cause(s) for this issue?* Is this an issue from Encoder to Youtube or Youtube to User issue? Or both? (We had plenty of local bandwidth, but got buffering and ""steam not available"" message on our player)* Should we assume that everyone had buffering? We didnt specifically ask in comments if anyone was seeing the feed well, so we arent sure.* How do you avoid (and test) for something like this from happening in the future?&#x200B;";False;When can we say live stream buffering issues are based on viewer side - region/ISP congestion issues or whether buffering is due to local network issues?;https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/b4x31s/when_can_we_say_live_stream_buffering_issues_are/

They complain and stop using the platform to give their business to other companies. The company almost always ends up fixing their mistakes, or falling into shambles and going under. This is simply not the case with our beloved and monopolized YouTube. If you want media entertainment, you go to one of these 3 places, live (or recorded) television, a streaming service like Netflix, Hulu, Prime video, etc. or YouTube. YouTube has changed the world of mainstream media, it's given a chance for creators to develop their own personal or broad audience, it's the new way of entertainment. But basiclly ever since Google bought it, they've been turning it into a Google thing, you know what I mean, a data farming advertiser is always right place. And the losses of many creators and the viewers complain constantly, but YouTube doesn't loose business, because there's no chance we're going back to big corporation controlled shows to stream or fake news and scheduled shows we have to wait for as our ONLY source of media. YouTube created a new type of media space, got us hooked on it, and proceeded to monopolize it in the capitalist way, and I have a SNEAKY SUSPICION and Google knew EXACTLY what they were doing. They knew exactly were they were headed, and they saw green, (oh yeah and YouTube Red to wrap themselves into their competitors work) and now, they can make their YouTube rewinds as trashy as they want, they wont loose any amount of business they're worried about, the only strike that would have an affect is if the majority of creators stopped uploading for a month, but they make money off of this, there's no chance of that happening. So what I'm saying is, nothing we're doing is gonna change the quite toxic environment of your data out for public use and the piggy banks (advertisers) first. We're stuck in an entertainment monopoly, Google is milking this as much as humanly possible, and like Amazon, the government is soon to be their ONLY competitor.&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;Anyways thanks for listening to my TED Talk.";False;Complaining about YouTube isn't gonna change anything.;https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/b4to13/complaining_about_youtube_isnt_gonna_change/

I got an email saying ""activity in my account violates community rules"" and my google account was disabled. Then after completing two step verification i got my account but i was unable to restore my channel. It had 46 thousand subscriber! I working months and years i just got monetized 3 months ago. I was uploading ANIME related content. I did not have any copyright claimed videos or any kind of strikes. I have appealed already and got rejected without getting any specific reason. After some research i found that contacting @teamyoutube will help. But i could not get any actual or specific reason behind my suspension. The fact that they are unable to provide any specific reason is enough for me to understand that they did not reviewed my channel properly. I think i am not popular enough to make them serious about my channel. I have also tried to contact them via email, but still was unable to contact any HUMAN.So, if is there any HUMAN official who will escalate my issue to the review team i will be very glad. I am 100 sure that my channel had nothing that violated the rules.Cause:1. I have never used any site or software to gain views or subscribers. Most of my views came from ""Youtube recommendation""2. I have never commented any other youtubers account with my channel name or link with it. I have never even replied a same comment in my videos.3. My tags, titles, thumbnails were not misleading. I had 95% likes in my videos. My videos were 3-4 minutes long and i used to have 2.14 minutes average watch-time.4. I have never spam tagged in my description. I just used to put 2/3 tags in the description related to my videos by hashtaging it.5. My videos were not sexual or any other type of harmfull content.So, please sir, i am totally broken after this.

I posted on my channel ""Broken Not Dead"" but thought this could be of some help for Youtubers starting out.On that note, I am not a big Youtuber (only 2.3k subs) but my channel started growing ""better"" after I applied those rules into my channel. I hope it helps some people and thank you for reading.&#x200B;Number 1: A Plan&#x200B;So you made your channel and you are ready to upload.... But what is your content? Do you have a niche you are trying to reach?You have to always remember that not always what may seem interesting to you will actually have the same interest to other people.Also, even if the content is interesting, are you actually passing the message to your viewers?Be a critic and look up other channels that cover the same area of interest and find what works for YOU! It is ok to be inspired by other channels and it is common to even in a way to mirror a lot of your content on other channels but you have to in time find who your real persona is on Youtube.&#x200B;Number 2: Have thick skin&#x200B;This is probably one of the most important things on Youtube. No matter the topic of your video or your niche, you will never please everyone. Not only that but there are a lot of trolls lurking on the internet and they may even comment on your videos with something that doesn't even relate to your video topic. The best way I found to deal with negative comments, be from trolls or by people just disagreeing with my position on the matter was: Listen, Understand, Discuss, Improve and Thank your audience.Why do I say that? Believe or not, I answer to every single comment on my channel. Many times I turned someone that were completely against me into someone that later on even defended me from other negative comments. Many times you will not fully pass the message that was intended. Always keep an open communication channel with your audience because they will drive your views. Don't do it as to play a PR game but really listen and try to better yourself in every video. If you can not deal with critiques and keep a leveled mind when you receive a negative review, you may not be cut out for Youtube.&#x200B;Number 3: Think long term&#x200B;Can you keep your channel going on your content alone? What do I mean by that? Is your content wide enough to keep going long term? Is this content interesting enough to keep people following your channel or is it something that will only see random people walking in and out of the channel?The best way I found to combat that was to not get my apples from the same tree. For example, if you have a tech channel, don't stick to only equipment review but try to branch out to other areas like ""Best configurations for your PC"" etc. It also may help you to find subscribers from different niches to follow your channel.&#x200B;Number 4: Don't beat yourself up&#x200B;You uploaded your first video and you believed it would be a hit and bring you to stardom and after a week you got 20 views and only 3 subs.... That's ok! Sure, someone between your parents, 2 sisters and facebook friends doesn't love you. No worries, keep uploading. You have to remember that there are almost 8 billion people in the world and new channels are never appealing since people don't know if you are just here and then gone ,if you are here to stay or if your next content will match your last video. The worst you can do for yourself is to just give up when you hit a roadblock. It is like they say in the movie ""Field of Dreams"": If you build they will come... or in your case, If you make content they will subscribe. So while you need to be a critic, don't beat yourself up.&#x200B;Number 5: Keep it clean&#x200B;One of the worst thing you can do is build a channel, get subscribers and upload dozens of videos just to have your channel shut down because of Strikes. Always make sure to understand the Youtube rules and make sure not to use copyrighted material. At times you may receive a copyright check on your video or that the content is not suitable for most advertisers. If you know that is not the case, Fight it! A lot can have happened in those cases: For example: Youtube automatically believes you used copyrighted material. What could be the case but you could be still protected under the ""Fair use Laws"" or a channel simply wants to get a bite from your pie and if you don't notice the claim, you may be out of some of your revenue and not even notice. So if you know you are in the right, Fight it. Another very important thing is: Follow the right practices on Youtube. What do I mean by that? People will offer you sub4sub, they will try to sell you ""real subscribers, real views, etc. DON'T DO IT! Chances are Youtube will find out and you'll have your channel shut down. If you really want to grow in the correct way, use platforms like Facebook, Reddit, Sharree and Google Ads. Those will get you real views and real subscribers. While may take longer, those people will keep following you and give you real views that you can be proud of.&#x200B;Number 6: Learn from your failures&#x200B;Learn to read Youtube Studio Analytics. This will give you a good idea of what has worked and what haven't on your videos. But don't rush to it. Give a month on each video and look up your numbers. This will tell you from how many people subscribed because of a certain video, how much of a video was watched, the percentage of clicks by impression, etc. Some of those numbers, like for example ""clicks by impression"" are usually driven by your thumbnail and video title and not the video itself so you need to take all of this into account. While a click bait will give you a high percentage on those numbers, the percentage of the video watched time will be really low and you may even lose a potential subscriber or someone that is already subscribed.Also do your research on best upload times, best practices, etc. Trust me, Youtube is a lot of work.&#x200B;Number 7: Be yourself and have fun&#x200B;Sure in the beginning you will be inspired by another youtuber and may even in part emulate the same for a time. It's ok. But you need to find yourself.I best heard that from Jordy from Cinecom.net. He tells that in the beginning he was very serious and tried to pass his information on a very professional way. The channel did OK but only that. One day he decided to start been himself and not put a front and the CHANNEL EXPLODED! Now he got over 1 million subscribers and is one of the best channels on my list. And the best part.... Have fun!!! Youtube gives you the chance to connect with billions of people. Some of you may change lives because of your content. You may give people hope, dreams, support or even a laughter when they need it most. You may give information to people that wouldn't have it otherwise.And the best of all.... You will Inspire!&#x200B;So go foward.... create, inspire and make your lives extraordinary&#x200B;Thank you all for reading.";False;7 Main Things to Have Success on Youtube;https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/b4izef/7_main_things_to_have_success_on_youtube/

The first month was first, was experimenting on stuff and found the idea of creating very satisfying, however for the last month I've hit a wall and was unable to create more videos. I'm the type of ""perfection"" creators, if I spot a mistake I don't continue until I go back and fix it, but after trying to figure the all concept of youtube encoding my videos on upload for the last 3 weeks, I've reached the point where I understand, I don't have enough knowledge to overcome this by myself. so let's start explaining:  From the start I will notify, I do understand that uploading a video to youtube will never result in the same video quality as the original file. However, I simply can't accept spending hours on 40-50 minutes video and get the result of the video looking like 320p with pixels ruining everything with every movement in the video. &#x200B;I'm recording my gameplay of horror games (in this example it's a 2D game) on my PS4 capture card which results a 720P, 30FPS video. then I transfer my videos from the PS4 to my PC to begin rendering it on my Lightworks PRO software. the videos result between 6 to 9 M-bitrates, now it's important to note before that I've tried to post this issue on youtube's community forum and within 20 days all I got was one answer telling me that my video looks bad because it's too big which is wrong because I was experimenting on bitrates by uploading a 20 seconds video which is 20 MB and looks the same way a 2GB or a 3GB of 1 hour video will look like, so it has nothing to do with the size. Now, per these two youtube's official uploading requirement:  1. [https://goo.gl/4FKkms](https://goo.gl/4FKkms)2. [https://goo.gl/b1Hp1c](https://goo.gl/b1Hp1c)The minimum bitrate acceptable for 720p 30 fps: 1.5 - 4 M-bitrates  OR limit of 5-6 M-Bitratesfor 720p 60 fps: 2 - 6 M-bitrates OR limit of 7.5 - 9 M-Bitrates&#x200B;The 20 seconds video I've exported goes around 6M-bitrates or 9M-bitrates (example: [https://ibb.co/wNfNrks](https://ibb.co/wNfNrks)) , and so for the past 3 weeks I've been trying to experiment by adjusting the bitrate myself in lightworks and another encoding software called TMPGEnc Video Mastering Works 6, that someone suggested (I have no idea how it works but I atleast figured out how to export the video in different formats and adjust the bitrate).  At first I was happy, I exported the video as a 2M-bitrates ([https://ibb.co/5xkH8VZ](https://ibb.co/5xkH8VZ)) and despite seeing a bit of the blurry I was ok with it, my intend was to never get a SUPER HD video, but just a normal one without pixels ruining it. However it didn't matter, no matter how many times I exported the video, the result was always the same, youtube butchered my video if it was 6Mbitrates or 4Mbitrates or 2MBitrates and I even tried 1Mbitrate but it always come to the same answer, it just kills to **415Kbps (**[https://ibb.co/5RD4Jjv](https://ibb.co/5RD4Jjv)) (I've downloaded my own videos from YouTube to compare and find the problem)  I've tried everything, I've tried exporting in H264, H265, WebM and more that I don't remember, I tried exporting it in the original video FPS by uploading it as a 720 30FPS to slow a bit of the movement in the video, doesn't work as well.   I've tried upscaling it, in 1080p no difference but upscaling it higher to 4K (VP9 encoding) removes the pixels problem HOWEVER, 1. the video becomes more blurry because it's out of resolution  and 2. I don't want to upload videos on 4K because not all browsers or console or video players support it, and also loading those video will require better internet from the viewers which will make others long loading time). This is simply is bigger than me and I can't solve it by myself, I can't contact YouTube creator support because I require 1000 followers and another requirements to contact them and I simply don't want to make shit videos just to reach that point, I feel very unsatisfied and disgusted by the way my videos look when I finish it, I just reached a dead end. I will be more than happy to make 2-3MBitrates videos with youtube's AVC1 encoding but it doesn't let me do it, it just depressing at this point.  If anyone can please help me to solve this, or even guide me on discord, you will really save me, because i'm going through some really tough times and creating videos actually put my head off from the problems and now i'm just in a frozen state for a month. I uploaded a picture ([https://i.imgur.com/DJQKIrK.png](https://i.imgur.com/DJQKIrK.png)) of the original quality video versus youtube's quality, and also here is the link for that 20seconds video, the best part to notice the pixel (which is all over the video) will be on the character's chest, the red ribbon: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFI4xoV0SdA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFI4xoV0SdA)&#x200B;thank you for taking your time to read this.";False;HELP: Can't solve Youtube's upload bitrade killing spree;https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/b4o5s6/help_cant_solve_youtubes_upload_bitrade_killing/

So this leads me to believe that someone reported a comment of mine in some video for hate speechNow sometimes I cuss a lot. But the deal here is that, even if I use a racial slur like n*gga I don't ever direct these towards anyone. Most times anyway (but never the racial slurs, ever). So like, did these assholes over at the YT HQ actually review my comment and found it to be hate speech? The email I received didn't even tell me why my channel was disabled for hate speech, just a generic heads up.And what's worse is that they're taking their sweet ass time reviewing my appeal. I sent it to them at around 11:20 am and I received an automated email saying that they've received my appeal application and will be reviewing it ASAP. Exactly 24 hours later I receive another automated email saying that they're now reviewing it. Now YT being based in the US (I think so anyway), I am 7 hours (AT LEAST) ahead of them, but it's still no excuse to how sluggish their service is. 5 hours later I'm refreshing my emails and I haven't even gotten a response yet.This just unacceptable. This is what happens when a company with a bright future that gets blessed by Google of all companies ends up getting pushed around by advertisers because they can't seem to figure out an alternative to ad income. They push around random users because they can't stand up to themselves.So on a bit of a sidenote I was wondering if anyone else has had something similar happen to them?";False;My channel was disabled because of hate speech???;https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/b4jsj3/my_channel_was_disabled_because_of_hate_speech/

At first I thought it was all a joke, but I was wrong. However, without much information from YT, I went ahead to delete 80% of my total video, bringing my total watch time from 35 million to 15 million, with over 110,000 subscribers.I try reaching YT agents, and teamyoutube on twitter, but none could help me. My Channel, is based on celebrities entertainment, most time I use free YouTube audio on my video, and I also have voice narrative on almost all my videos, and carefully edited. But YT auto system took away my monetization, without considering manually checking my channel.However, I deleted all those videos with free audio, and made other adjustment, after waiting for 30 days, I reapplied, Up to this day, YT has not given me back my monetization, at the moment I'm getting at least 100,000 views per day, The panful thing is that, many channel out there, who don't take time to edit their videos, without voice narrative, still have monetization. And I narrate all my videos. So, I'm using this medium to plead with anyone out there, who can help me contact YouTube on my behave, should be assist.

I make this post as a catharsis so if anyone is offended by what I am about to say, I apologize, from the endocardium (the deepest part of the heart. Yes :) it is never too late to learn something new). As you know, YouTube started a kind of video hunt about the New Zealand shooting and has disabled the most important function of its engine: filter the results by upload date. Dear YouTube staff Wouldn't it be better to disable YouTube altogether? For a few days or weeks until those sick people who upload that kind of material to your page, which incidentally comes since it was bought by Google, in resounding decay. What if instead of placing a stupid automated message you gave us an approximate date of when you will re-enable your smart search? Google video is not the solution: Google videos give you incoherent results. Bing can be a solution ... but google NO! It's as bad as its translator. Your supposed intelligent search loses by wide beating with DuckDuckGo. However, God doesn't even know when such sick and depraved people will stop uploading that stupid video! What's the fun of seeing such an aberrant genocide? What's the fun of uploading or promoting such videos? ENOUGH! ENOUGH OF UPLOADING THAT SHIT! WHOEVER IS UPLOADING LIKE A COMPUTER WORM THAT DAMN VIDEO STOP DOING IT. THEY'RE FUCKING YOUTUBE DAMN IT, THEY PULLED OUT THEIR SMARTEST FUNCTION AND MADE IT A DUMMY.Why am I anxious to get the filter search function back to YouTube? Because like many, I'm excited to create my first YouTube channel. For what purpose? To be able to promote any Indi game developer who wants to make himself known and doesn't have the money to promote his project, what am I going to do? Try out independent video games to let the world know the talent of others. Is that a crime, YouTube? No. Who would watch my videos if when you put in the keywords the newest video is 1 month or 3 weeks ago? or even 6 months or 1 year ago. It CANNOT BE!

Over the past couple of days, many people (including myself) have had their accounts terminated over hate speech without warning seemingly out of nowhere. There have been many posts on here over the past couple of days showing numerous examples of this. My account and many others were 5-10 years old and had serious amounts of time sunk into them. My activity in the weeks prior to being suspended was not any different than my activity at any point in the past ten years. I had no videos besides a few personal ones uploaded years past, and while I may have had some edgy comments posted from years and years ago I doubt they have anything significant enough to warrant a ban. People who uploaded the shooting or encouraged any type of behavior like that definitely deserve punishment. The problem is there seems to be a large amount of people were swept up out of the blue and didn't do anything along those lines. This is what leads me to believe that whatever youtube did may have accidentally blanket terminated people who checked some sort of key word in some aspect of their account even if that element was present before the shooting (for example my user name since 2015 or so was ""remove kebab"" , a meme the shooter used).I'm going through the normal means to get my account unbanned, I just thought that I would make this post to spread awareness and hopefully garner some attention towards the issue.www.youtube.com/user/thegangstajacktl;dr I think YouTube banned a bunch of people accidentally because they had something on their account which vaguely fulfilled some sort of algorithmic check box, even if they didn't do anything wrong.

One that maybe we can start a petition for youtube to implement? The ability for youtubers to subscribe to and receive email notifications of individual playlists!You currently have the ability to subscribe to an entire channel, and once you're subscribed, you can click the bell icon to receive email notifications for that channel. However, there are plenty of channels that provide variety content, and those channels often have entire chunks of their subscriber base who are only interested in one type of content. My channel is one such variety channel.Because some of my fans are only interested in one type of content, they do not receive email notifications because they do not want their email inbox flooded with upload notifications they only have a 1 in 5 chance of actually caring about. This means that they often simply check my channel page every once in a while to see if I've uploaded any videos that interest them, dramatically increasing the chances that they might miss something.If, however, we had the ability to turn on notifications for individual playlists, fans would be much less hesitant to turn on said notifications. They would set up notifications for the series they want to follow, and never miss a single episode of those series, resulting in more views overall for the content creators.

Between Content ID and scrubbing search terms and other meta data they could pretty much squash the uploads.  But instead they intentionally cripple a key feature of YouTube.

I would like to start out by saying that my recommended page was fine up until recently. Specifically on mobile there were no video that were recommended to me that weren't related to my subscriptions (I only have 10 or so.) and although I would get unrelated video every once in a while it wasn't bad and I could ignore them. I didn't really have too much of an issue until I wiped my watch history from my YouTube channel. This is when I started getting videos completely unrelated to anything that I watch on this platform and every time I tried to press the ""I am not interested"" button there would be even more unrelated videos that I did not want watch including but not limited to, videos in another language I didn't understand(I'm in the US and that is what my location is set to.), sports highlights (Basketball and football were frequent), videos about make-up, among other videos I did not want to watch nor would I ever want to watch. Sometimes the videos that I had already said I wasn't interested in would reappear. &#x200B;This why I am writing this post. When I come here to this subreddit all I see are complaints about the recommended section of Youtube but none of the posts I have have actually suggested ideas to improve the section**(maybe there a few that I missed but when I used the search bar for this subreddit they didn't appear. If there are posts I missed please respond with the post that already did this I will delete this one or link to the posts that I missed)**. Now this complaints do have reasons for existing and in fact a majority of the complaints that I have seen regarding the recommended section are constructive. However, there aren't many that I have seen that offer solutions to the issues that are brought up by the criticisms of the section. &#x200B;In this post I will make a series of recommended fixes for these issues and I hope that whoever responds will add to this post. I also hope that this will be seen by YouTube's higher up and I hope that they will implement these suggestions to make the recommended section better. &#x200B;\-My first suggestion to fix the recommended section would be to have a completely separate menu so that users can customize their experience. This recommended section menu can have a country drop down menu so that only videos from a selected country will appear or it can have multiple drop down menus to allow for videos from multiple countries. Also if nothing has been selected in the recommended section menu, the recommended section should be based off of subscriptions and not watch history or a combination of subscriptions and watch history so that the user doesn't get videos he/she doesn't want to watch&#x200B;\-My second suggestion is have a sort by menu similar to how the search bar works. This one was actually brought up in a recent post that I saw asking for the recommended section to have a sort by popular option. I don't remember the name of the op and so I apologize for not having it but whomever it is I give full credit to you for this suggestion.&#x200B;\-My third suggestion would be to have a feature similar to desktop on mobile. The feature that I'm talking about is the ""grouping feature"". This feature basically groups together similar videos by topic. This would vastly improve the amount of effort needed to tell the algorithm ""I'm not interested in topic A"" because then the videos could either be selected one by one or selected by group to tell the algorithm that I'm not interested in this topic.&#x200B;So, what do you think of these suggestions? These are some that I just thought off the top of my head when I started writing this post. I'm sure that there are more that I am not thinking but I figured that anyone who wants to improve the platform will comment with more suggestions, critique my own suggestions or add on to the suggestions I already mentioned above.  &#x200B;&#x200B;  ";False;Ideas for the recommended videos section of YouTube;https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/b46bqr/ideas_for_the_recommended_videos_section_of/

Youtube gets content from creators and pays very little for it, if anything at all. The majority of creators are working free for Youtube when you think about it.

Take away the money.&#x200B;Youtube doesn't have to pay anything to those companies if they take down the video immediately. That is their only legal obligation, remove the video. They are not obligated to pay them if they take it down. They keep the video up to make money.&#x200B;So there has to be a class action against Youtube for profiting off fraudulent practices. Lawyers are expensive but if creators form an organization and donate five dollars to a legal fund it would add up to a massive amount because so many creators are hurt by these practices.

A jury trial will affect the price of their stock and if they have to pay everyone it's going to easily be in the millions. &#x200B;That's the only way I see how this can be stopped.

I rarely even bother monetizing many of my videos because they are usually so short that an ad seems inappropriate. Here's a short example. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1RegHNhqpY  I want to say an algorithm detected some videos like this and figured I was just uploading other people's videos so they demonetized my channel. If that's the case, then I should be able to reapply for monetization privileges in 30 days without worry, because then a human will be reviewing, and they'll be able to see any of the algorithmically flagged videos were false positives.Or, another possibility I'm thinking is that I have too many videos that have copyright claims, even though they are not DMCA takedowns. Youtube says having these sort of claims doesn't affect your account standing but maybe it does now? I have lots of content either with copyright claims either by content ID, or from someone manually claiming it. I typically leave those alone unless I'm sure it qualifies as fair use. Sometimes I don't do much editing on a video and figure it's not ""transformative"" enough so I don't bother disputing the claim. I even have a few gameplay videos which have music and I'm sure it's not justifiable as fair use and I don't even bother trying to monetize those in the first place.What do you guys think?

But I havent seen any word on this recently, like as of 2019. Youtube is still doing this? If so, its quite the tease..I post a video a week, every friday. And my most viewed video is at 370-ish (Im only a couple weeks into my channel). But my most recent video (posted last friday) ‘blew up’ - lol im joking, not really but for my standards it was doing very well. It would usually take the video all week to reach 100, but this one hit 250 in 5 days, and had 100 by the end of day 1. And I was honestly really excited and proud to see this growth (Ik, Im lame). But at one point late last night YT just stripped like 80 views!! 250 down to 175...I mean, I realize Im just mindlessly complaining. But you know how discouraging this is for a new youtuber. Especially one whos honest and isnt cheating views. On the first day, the rise in views was random. So I thought Id capitilize on it and do a ton of time expensive promotion. Did Youtube, see my spike in views and suspect I was fishy or something? Have you had views drop then comeback? Like, do they temporarily remove views, check their legitmacy and then bring then back?Alright rant over, sorry guys this annoyed the F outta me and I dont really have anyone to talk to.

In this case, the 10 hour long video should work then.Does anyone know the work-around with this issue?From my understanding of reading other posts, after a video is uploaded, there is a processing, which youtube then formats the 8 resolution sizes for the video.It did take awhile to process, but the process step has already been completed before publishing.&#x200B;&#x200B;I currently use Davinci Resolve, and exported in the recommended settings based on Davinci resolve (switching from Quicktime to .Mp4) to export in .MP4 file format.I also have HandBrake, which was the initial upload of the 6:30 hour long video.";False;4k UHD Video Not shown as 2160p, but as 360p;https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/b3uh34/4k_uhd_video_not_shown_as_2160p_but_as_360p/

The latest is that comments have been disabled for all videos, making it impossible to talk about the contents, to share similar or different experiences, or leaving input.

TL;DR at the bottom!# A Brief HistoryMy channel is a few years old. At first it was a supplement to my Twitch livestreams. I uploaded clips and eventually made some exclusive content revolving around the video game I was playing. Every once in a while I would upload a cat video or a review of some product just because. My videos usually reached high 3-digit, low 4-digit views with some mid 5-digit view clips every once in a while. I was approved for monetization before it was heavily branded as the ""YouTube Partnership Program"", before the subscriber and watch-hour threshold was introduced. I was making a few bucks for my efforts, and I jumped back and forth between MCN's before eventually just sticking to a 1 on 1 relationship with YouTube for my earnings.My first video blew up in 2016 and had nothing to do with my regular uploads. I had messed around with VFX software and superimposed Cthulhu knocking down the Willis Tower in Chicago over some old footage of a tornado siren in a rain storm. That video is now creeping close to 3 million views. Of course this spurred a change in my uploads, and pushed me to exclusively create these monster attacking videos. I've made more Cthulhu clips, some UFO clips, sea monsters, dragons, Godzilla, you name it, all participating in various pandemonic activities. I threw together ""top 5"" videos of my own content. My subscriber count climbed steadily, and my total channel view count was approaching 10 million. People were stealing my content left and right, including my unaltered clips in their own compilations, and 100% of my copyright strikes were approved within hours. Some of those offenders apologized and offered to attribute proper credit. These people are now some of my best internet friends. Everything was coasting well.# The DemonetizationMy channel survived through the adpocalypse, and I managed to retain a perfect channel standing, despite the malicious efforts of a select few. In December of 2018, I noticed that my estimated earnings for the past 28 days was dropping, and by quite a bit. Normally I expect a fluctuation of a few dollars per week but I was losing tens of dollars every day. I went to my enabled features page on YouTube and saw that my monetization was disabled, and had been so for 10 days. I never received a notification or email, so honestly my first thought was that I had been hacked or something. Upon further investigation, I discovered that this was done purposefully by YouTube, citing that I had violated the community guidelines. Their reason was cited as ""**misleading metadata**"". The claim was that my videos or my metadata was misleading in order to trick people into giving me views (this is my own paraphrasing, I don't recall the exact verbiage. I'm sure it can be found in the community guidelines). No specifics were offered, not which video(s) were in violation or if it was reported or anything. On top of this, I was unable to reapply for monetization for 30 days as of the demonetization. Since I only found this 10 days into my demonetizaiton, I would have to wait another 20 to reapply.At first I figured this might be a mistake, but to be safe I went through all of my videos and removed any tags that might be misconstrued as misleading. Anywhere I had mentioned the word ""real"" in these VFX videos, I removed. I removed any synonyms that might miss the mark too much (for example, I removed ""sea monster"" from Godzilla clips). The most frustrating part of all of this was that other channels were doing the exact same thing as me, some using OTHER people's content without permission or credit attribution, and were still monetized. At this point, I was pretty sure that my demonetization was erroneous.# The ReapplicationAfter my 20 days, in early January 2019, I reapplied for monetization. The reapplication process is literally clicking a button that says ""Reapply"". There is no form to plead a case or include any information at all. After clicking the magic button, my monetization page forwarded to a page with 5 or so sentences, including the quip that the application was said to take ""about a month"". I hardly uploaded around this time because my motivation was gone. I created a couple of clips just to keep the channel afloat while this was all going on. About half way through this wait time, one of my top 5 videos EXPLODED. I went from 2-10 thousand views per day to well over **100,000 views per day**. This was probably the most frustrated I had felt in a long time. I was losing sleep over missing out on hundreds of dollars over this nonsense and it was infuriating. I started really taking this issue seriously at this point, and did some research on what I could possibly do, until I came across the TeamYouTube twitter.This account seemed to be helpful for a handful of larger creators and I figured I would give it a shot. I tweeted at them, and they actually responded within a day. They asked for a screenshot of my analytics page, which I provided, and got no response. I started over with them a few days later, and they responded with the same message that I was reading: here is the community guideline that you are reported to be violating. I pleaded my case that this may be erroneous, and the twitter account said they would forward it to someone for me. Finally, some hope! I waited a week or so with no update, until a change was made to my monetization page...# The Verdict... In late January, 2019, my reapplication for remonetization had been denied. This time, however, the reason cited was no longer misleading metadata, but instead: ""**Reused Content""**. I was floored by this, at no point had I used anyone else's content in any of my videos. All of my top 5's were my own clips, and all of my clips were of my own creation. Maybe using my videos again in top 5's is what YouTube is referring to? But other channels do this all the time. While yes, the monsters were superimposed over footage that I found online, this is extremely transformative in nature and falls well under the guise of fair use. The precedent had been set for this as I had countless successful claims of my own, as well as denied strikes against my channel from others. YouTube's new reasoning here is only half of my frustration; why is YouTube switching up their reasons for demonetizing like this? It is as though they are just randomly assigning issues to my channel that don't exist to keep me from monetizing. Again, they do not provide specifics as to how I am violating guidelines, which videos are doing it, if it was the source of user reports, or anything specific at all. As with the previous demonetization, this one allowed me to reapply. So again, I waited until I could try once more.# The Re-ReapplicationIn mid February 2019, I was able to click the magic button again. This time around, my analytics page did not forward me to that 5 sentence text page, but instead to the page that you see when you first apply for monetization, which I thought was peculiar. This is the page that has the green check marks next to the thresholds for applying for monetization. I tweeted at team YouTube again just for good measure and got no response. At this point I had been reading forum posts on Reddit and Google Help forums, most recently citing applications taking over 3 months. I figured since I was able to procure help from TeamYouTube last time, I got lucky and my application was reviewed really quickly, and that this time I would be out of luck. 30 days passed, and this seemed to be the case. I had not gotten any answer yet. At this point I pretty much gave up, and considered moving on from creating for YouTube.# The Verdict II, ReloadedI had admittedly been ignoring my earnings page at this point. There was no point in checking as every day it just said $0.00. In mid March, 2019, I decided to take a peak at my enabled features page on a whim, and SURPRISE, MY MONETIZATION WAS *ENABLED*! I just about had a heart attack, I thought maybe I was misreading what feature was enabled on my page. I checked my earnings page, and sure enough, I had been earning for the past 7 days! Again, no notification or email from YouTube, just a quiet remonetization, available for every single one of my uploads. No yellow dollar signs.The moral of the story here is at the end of the day, YouTube creators have exactly 0 control and one should avoid treating the platform as a right instead of a privilege. You can do everything right and follow the guidelines as closely as you feasibly can, and your channel can still lose monetization for several months, or perhaps indefinitely, for whatever unenforced reason.Hopefully this story has helped or inspired those on a similar path, and to not give up hope! I'm happy to answer any questions in the comments.**TL;DR:** Demonetized (what I believe to be erroneously) for ""misleading metadata"". Reapplied unceremoniously, and was denied again for ""reused content"" (again, erroneously). Didn't change anything, applied a third time and was reinstated.

And for what little those music claims or whatever are, it should not even take a week, let alone 3 days to sort through so few claims.So one idea is this: have it so that if a claim/strike release isn't addressed in a week, it will automatically be released.Firstly, these bots will likely strike them again, so not a bit issue for companies, however it will be more publicized if it keeps getting unverified strikes and claims.Secondly, if a big company wants to be serious about these claims/strikes, they need to put in some actual effort into making sure copyright is upheld and actually get a large team to get through these as fast as possible. After all, they are making thousands of dollars off of these claims alone, and could easily afford their own team of copyright enforcers.Claimers/Strikers need some rules to follow too, you know what I mean? There needs to be restrictions for them as well.Another idea is this: if a video gets falsely claimed/striked, grant immunity of being claimed/striked for a period of time, which times could possibly vary and maybe even exponentially increase for every claim/strike. This makes it so bots don't constantly bully others with constant strikes making someone's entire channel unwatchable.And for companies who are lazy or even bullying/terrorizing other users, there should be a way to directly sue a company and/or keep track of a company. Rules such as, ""you must be a verified company/channel by YouTube to strike for this or claim for that, and if you make things too complicated, you will lose that right,"" or whatever. Just something to regulate the flow of strikers/claimers.There are so many ways to go about this, so have fun discussing these in the comments.";False;"Claimers/Strikers need rules too: simple solutions to companies and people abusing ""copyright claim"" and ""copyright strikes.""";https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/b3lu1t/claimersstrikers_need_rules_too_simple_solutions/

YouTube, to me, lately has been the same dopamine-craving, empty, void of any meaning social media that Facebook and Snapchat already were. I don't get any joy out of being addicted on YouTube anymore. **And it's all due to being unable to find videos that I care for anymore.**I have an older YouTube account that I hadn't been using anymore for the last 5 years. I went back on it to go through my watch history to get nostalgic, and one thing immediately stood out to me: my watch history back then is completely different from what my current watch history is! And I don't mean specific videos or that I have different interests now, I mean that **my current watch history is way more monotone: the same people, the same channels, over and over again.**I started watching some of those old videos again: a lot of them were obscure **with less than a 100k views or even only thousands of views today.** But all of them were of much better quality creative wise and in terms of variety.And it got me thinking: why? How did I find these videos back then, a lot of them classics that I hold dear to my heart, and **why can't I find those kinds of videos anymore**? I mean, back then I wasn't actively searching niche videos, yet I still found them, whereas today, I can't.And that's when I saw the recommendations next to the video that I was watching. The video that I was watching was obscure and old; a Japanese song that was ripped from nicovideo. Back in the days when I found this video, **the recommended videos would have had something to do with that Japanese video - either based on title, the current channel or the tags from the videos.** This meant it was easy for me to find more videos like this, regardless how obscure that video was. **View counts, verified statuses and video time- those all didn't matter.**But now - that same video has the most bland, generic and godawful recommendations next to it. **There is not a single video in that list that has something to do with the current video.** It's all ""Saturday Night Live"" (which I never even watch), ""Game Grumps"" (which I do watch frequently but has NOTHING to do with the video), or that one clickbait video that seems to get recommended to everyone for months regardless of interests.It doesn't matter which video I chose, it doesn't matter how often I refresh te page and it doesn't even matter if I clear my recommendations. The list stays roughly the same for everything, forever. **I can't find new videos anymore. I can only see channels I liked in the past or that others ""like me"" like.**And just like that YouTube's machine learning has sucked me into my bubble. I can't find opposing videos anymore without actively searching for them and even then YouTube doesn't put those videos at the top, **I can't find niche videos anymore because those don't make YouTube any money** and I sure as hell can't even find any old videos I've watched  that are hidden deep down in my Search History (which btw, still doesn't have any sort or filtering system) **since YouTube just acts like I've never watched those kinds of videos** \- no no, watch some of these bland and sh\*t videos instead that generate us heaps of cash, whether you like it or not.The thing that hurts me the most is that **I know these niche types of content is still being made**. I'll just never, ever be able to find them anymore thanks to YouTube itself.The giant database of interesting videos is being dumbed down because a system thinks it knows me better than I do - or that acts on its own bias to only get money out of me, whatever the cost.YouTube lost the thing that made it great - and there's not even a good alternative to YouTube which makes it only sadder. I guess that means there's no point for me to go to YouTube anymore except for maybe occasionally checking my subs.I hope I'm not the only one who feels annoyed at YouTube for their way of running things nowadays. There are lots of problems with their copyright system, demonetisation system and - still ongoing, but less bad - ElsaGate stuff, that stuff like this never really seem to get as much attention.

I've been working hard to make the video fit for kids by trying to keep your rules. if I have broken these rules, it was unintentionally and I apologize. What I think is that I've probably tried to make youtube friends by commenting on their videos. Some of my comments were copy paste, and maybe that might be misunderstood. just to be practical I wrote in this form. and again, this has been done inadvertently and will not be repeated. I am also reading your rules for a while to not repeat the same mistake. My channel has no copyright issues, sexual content, or incitement to violence, and so on.
