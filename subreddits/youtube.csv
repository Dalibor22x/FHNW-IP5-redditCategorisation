I witnessed it myself some time ago, on a YouTuber's F.A.Q. video. I commented with my own question, and I've suddenly seen it becoming a generic joke. I panicked out and quit the video and reentered it again, the comment was still the same. So I've relaunched YouTube (I was on my phone) to see the video again, and my comment was back to normal. Yet it happened again on a discussion I was having, but from the side of the person I was talking with - I saw the reply as a normal answer to my statement in the notification, then when I loaded the video, it became generic and unrelated. I ended up reloading the video, and the reply went back to being the one I've originally seen on the notification. I'd conclude that it is simply a strange YouTube bug, and I hope it will be solved soon.;False;Don't worry if your comment changes, it will change back soon.;https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/b539qi/dont_worry_if_your_comment_changes_it_will_change/

I had a youtube channel of 6 years that I was working on and have used the same name of the channel for all 6 years. 2 years ago someone else came by and trademarked the EXACT name I was using. He sat on it and waited until we had our first successful year with some growth then he filed for trademark infringement on our year in review video. I googled around called lawyers and got advice from them. Everyone basically said that the USA is a first to use country meaning simply because he trademarked the name I still have protection because I used it before him in the same format. Meanwhile I communicated with this guy trying to work something out and he said he would get back to me in a couple of days so we can work something out. But a couple of days is the window youtube gave for us to work something out so he just waited out the youtube system and youtube immediately TERMINATED my account. Not tell me to change the name or take the custom url, simply erased from existence. So from that time I sent in an appeal to them explaining the situation. A couple of weeks go by no response. Tweet to @teamyoutube and tell them I sent an appeal with no answer. ""We've forwarded that to our team and will get back to you with any updates"". Wait a couple more weeks still nothing. Tweet again ""We've forwarded that to our team and will get back to you with any updates. We appreciate your patience. Tweet them a couple more times, get ignored. A month and a half goes by, I send another appeal and tweet STILL nothing. So now I say fuck it get a lawyer so I can cancel the guys trademark and get my channel back.Hire lawyer they say it should be a simple slam dunk especially if he's not even using it. File the petition to cancel. Hear from the guy who owns the trademark trying to compromise with me because this could cost both of us $20,000. Tell him I'm not interested in anything he is offering we either let it go through the legal process or I pay him to relinquish the trademark. A week later he decides to voluntarily relinquish the trademark.So where am I at now? His trademark is canceled, @teamyoutube doesn't respond to ANY of my tweets about my appeal. Sent a third appeal in with no response and have spent about 3 grand on the whole legal process. How do I go about getting my channel back? It's not trademark infringing (it never was), youtube has no point of contact to explain this and I'm out of options.TLDR; Youtube wrongfully terminated my account because someone trademarked my channel name.

The situation was as follows: We were pushing 5 different streams (different languages) to Wowza cloud which was distributing to various destinations including Youtube. One point to note is our wowza settings were going to Akamai first so we could use Primary/Backup ingest setup (we came to later know that this ""route"" ads an extra step in the delivery that can cause latency/buffering). On one system (Imac 2017), the destination was our main Youtube channel, for a few hours things were generally OK, however at one point during the event we reached appx 60K concurrent viewers. This is the time when we started seeing from our side and viewers side lots of buffering. Unfortunately, at the exact same time, Youtube was giving us an internal 500 server error, which prohibited us from viewing our dashboard and stream health, but we did notice our Wowza stream health had lots of incoming/outgoing datarate fluctuations. The buffering issue wasnt the case on the other channels that we were streaming to. Because the buffering was so bad, we were constantly switching on/off our wirecast feed to resume the stream, where it would switch between Akamai's Primary and Backup. Strangely, once the archive video was processed, we didnt see much issue except for this switching between Primary & Backup. Once the concurrent views dropped back to appx. 5K, things again settled back down and we didnt have any more issues.So, we're wanting to understand a few things:* What could have been the root cause(s) for this issue?* Is this an issue from Encoder to Youtube or Youtube to User issue? Or both? (We had plenty of local bandwidth, but got buffering and ""steam not available"" message on our player)* Should we assume that everyone had buffering? We didnt specifically ask in comments if anyone was seeing the feed well, so we arent sure.* How do you avoid (and test) for something like this from happening in the future?&#x200B;";False;When can we say live stream buffering issues are based on viewer side - region/ISP congestion issues or whether buffering is due to local network issues?;https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/b4x31s/when_can_we_say_live_stream_buffering_issues_are/

How can i bring them back? - My brother and I share our YouTube account so i can keep an eye on what he views on YouTube. 1 channel was separated into 2 and i used the primary one. - He explains what happened: - Apparently he listened to lots of clips of a specific audiobook on YouTube and had the foolish idea of uploading a part of the audiobook as he had the full audiobook with him. - He edited it, cut it, uses another mic. to re-record the audiobook with aberrations so that he wouldn't get copyrighted. - He uploaded the video to his channel, no copyright so far. - Thousands on viewers listened.

They complain and stop using the platform to give their business to other companies. The company almost always ends up fixing their mistakes, or falling into shambles and going under. This is simply not the case with our beloved and monopolized YouTube. If you want media entertainment, you go to one of these 3 places, live (or recorded) television, a streaming service like Netflix, Hulu, Prime video, etc. or YouTube. YouTube has changed the world of mainstream media, it's given a chance for creators to develop their own personal or broad audience, it's the new way of entertainment. But basiclly ever since Google bought it, they've been turning it into a Google thing, you know what I mean, a data farming advertiser is always right place. And the losses of many creators and the viewers complain constantly, but YouTube doesn't loose business, because there's no chance we're going back to big corporation controlled shows to stream or fake news and scheduled shows we have to wait for as our ONLY source of media. YouTube created a new type of media space, got us hooked on it, and proceeded to monopolize it in the capitalist way, and I have a SNEAKY SUSPICION and Google knew EXACTLY what they were doing. They knew exactly were they were headed, and they saw green, (oh yeah and YouTube Red to wrap themselves into their competitors work) and now, they can make their YouTube rewinds as trashy as they want, they wont loose any amount of business they're worried about, the only strike that would have an affect is if the majority of creators stopped uploading for a month, but they make money off of this, there's no chance of that happening. So what I'm saying is, nothing we're doing is gonna change the quite toxic environment of your data out for public use and the piggy banks (advertisers) first. We're stuck in an entertainment monopoly, Google is milking this as much as humanly possible, and like Amazon, the government is soon to be their ONLY competitor.&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;&#x200B;Anyways thanks for listening to my TED Talk.";False;Complaining about YouTube isn't gonna change anything.;https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/b4to13/complaining_about_youtube_isnt_gonna_change/

I got an email saying ""activity in my account violates community rules"" and my google account was disabled. Then after completing two step verification i got my account but i was unable to restore my channel. It had 46 thousand subscriber! I working months and years i just got monetized 3 months ago. I was uploading ANIME related content. I did not have any copyright claimed videos or any kind of strikes. I have appealed already and got rejected without getting any specific reason. After some research i found that contacting @teamyoutube will help. But i could not get any actual or specific reason behind my suspension. The fact that they are unable to provide any specific reason is enough for me to understand that they did not reviewed my channel properly. I think i am not popular enough to make them serious about my channel. I have also tried to contact them via email, but still was unable to contact any HUMAN.So, if is there any HUMAN official who will escalate my issue to the review team i will be very glad. I am 100 sure that my channel had nothing that violated the rules.Cause:1. I have never used any site or software to gain views or subscribers. Most of my views came from ""Youtube recommendation""2. I have never commented any other youtubers account with my channel name or link with it. I have never even replied a same comment in my videos.3. My tags, titles, thumbnails were not misleading. I had 95% likes in my videos. My videos were 3-4 minutes long and i used to have 2.14 minutes average watch-time.4. I have never spam tagged in my description. I just used to put 2/3 tags in the description related to my videos by hashtaging it.5. My videos were not sexual or any other type of harmfull content.So, please sir, i am totally broken after this. Working so long and buildup such a big channel(to me), getting monetized after waiting for 8-9 months and then getting suspended without any warning or reason i dont know how to focus on anything.

The first month was first, was experimenting on stuff and found the idea of creating very satisfying, however for the last month I've hit a wall and was unable to create more videos. I'm the type of ""perfection"" creators, if I spot a mistake I don't continue until I go back and fix it, but after trying to figure the all concept of youtube encoding my videos on upload for the last 3 weeks, I've reached the point where I understand, I don't have enough knowledge to overcome this by myself. so let's start explaining:  From the start I will notify, I do understand that uploading a video to youtube will never result in the same video quality as the original file. However, I simply can't accept spending hours on 40-50 minutes video and get the result of the video looking like 320p with pixels ruining everything with every movement in the video. &#x200B;I'm recording my gameplay of horror games (in this example it's a 2D game) on my PS4 capture card which results a 720P, 30FPS video. then I transfer my videos from the PS4 to my PC to begin rendering it on my Lightworks PRO software. the videos result between 6 to 9 M-bitrates, now it's important to note before that I've tried to post this issue on youtube's community forum and within 20 days all I got was one answer telling me that my video looks bad because it's too big which is wrong because I was experimenting on bitrates by uploading a 20 seconds video which is 20 MB and looks the same way a 2GB or a 3GB of 1 hour video will look like, so it has nothing to do with the size. Now, per these two youtube's official uploading requirement:  1. [https://goo.gl/4FKkms](https://goo.gl/4FKkms)2. [https://goo.gl/b1Hp1c](https://goo.gl/b1Hp1c)The minimum bitrate acceptable for 720p 30 fps: 1.5 - 4 M-bitrates  OR limit of 5-6 M-Bitratesfor 720p 60 fps: 2 - 6 M-bitrates OR limit of 7.5 - 9 M-Bitrates&#x200B;The 20 seconds video I've exported goes around 6M-bitrates or 9M-bitrates (example: [https://ibb.co/wNfNrks](https://ibb.co/wNfNrks)) , and so for the past 3 weeks I've been trying to experiment by adjusting the bitrate myself in lightworks and another encoding software called TMPGEnc Video Mastering Works 6, that someone suggested (I have no idea how it works but I atleast figured out how to export the video in different formats and adjust the bitrate).  At first I was happy, I exported the video as a 2M-bitrates ([https://ibb.co/5xkH8VZ](https://ibb.co/5xkH8VZ)) and despite seeing a bit of the blurry I was ok with it, my intend was to never get a SUPER HD video, but just a normal one without pixels ruining it. However it didn't matter, no matter how many times I exported the video, the result was always the same, youtube butchered my video if it was 6Mbitrates or 4Mbitrates or 2MBitrates and I even tried 1Mbitrate but it always come to the same answer, it just kills to **415Kbps (**[https://ibb.co/5RD4Jjv](https://ibb.co/5RD4Jjv)) (I've downloaded my own videos from YouTube to compare and find the problem)  I've tried everything, I've tried exporting in H264, H265, WebM and more that I don't remember, I tried exporting it in the original video FPS by uploading it as a 720 30FPS to slow a bit of the movement in the video, doesn't work as well.   I've tried upscaling it, in 1080p no difference but upscaling it higher to 4K (VP9 encoding) removes the pixels problem HOWEVER, 1. the video becomes more blurry because it's out of resolution  and 2. I don't want to upload videos on 4K because not all browsers or console or video players support it, and also loading those video will require better internet from the viewers which will make others long loading time). This is simply is bigger than me and I can't solve it by myself, I can't contact YouTube creator support because I require 1000 followers and another requirements to contact them and I simply don't want to make shit videos just to reach that point, I feel very unsatisfied and disgusted by the way my videos look when I finish it, I just reached a dead end. I will be more than happy to make 2-3MBitrates videos with youtube's AVC1 encoding but it doesn't let me do it, it just depressing at this point.  If anyone can please help me to solve this, or even guide me on discord, you will really save me, because i'm going through some really tough times and creating videos actually put my head off from the problems and now i'm just in a frozen state for a month.

So this leads me to believe that someone reported a comment of mine in some video for hate speechNow sometimes I cuss a lot. But the deal here is that, even if I use a racial slur like n*gga I don't ever direct these towards anyone. Most times anyway (but never the racial slurs, ever). So like, did these assholes over at the YT HQ actually review my comment and found it to be hate speech? The email I received didn't even tell me why my channel was disabled for hate speech, just a generic heads up.And what's worse is that they're taking their sweet ass time reviewing my appeal. I sent it to them at around 11:20 am and I received an automated email saying that they've received my appeal application and will be reviewing it ASAP. Exactly 24 hours later I receive another automated email saying that they're now reviewing it. Now YT being based in the US (I think so anyway), I am 7 hours (AT LEAST) ahead of them, but it's still no excuse to how sluggish their service is. 5 hours later I'm refreshing my emails and I haven't even gotten a response yet.This just unacceptable. This is what happens when a company with a bright future that gets blessed by Google of all companies ends up getting pushed around by advertisers because they can't seem to figure out an alternative to ad income.

I posted on my channel ""Broken Not Dead"" but thought this could be of some help for Youtubers starting out.On that note, I am not a big Youtuber (only 2.3k subs) but my channel started growing ""better"" after I applied those rules into my channel. I hope it helps some people and thank you for reading.&#x200B;Number 1: A Plan&#x200B;So you made your channel and you are ready to upload.... But what is your content? Do you have a niche you are trying to reach?You have to always remember that not always what may seem interesting to you will actually have the same interest to other people.Also, even if the content is interesting, are you actually passing the message to your viewers?Be a critic and look up other channels that cover the same area of interest and find what works for YOU! It is ok to be inspired by other channels and it is common to even in a way to mirror a lot of your content on other channels but you have to in time find who your real persona is on Youtube.&#x200B;Number 2: Have thick skin&#x200B;This is probably one of the most important things on Youtube. No matter the topic of your video or your niche, you will never please everyone. Not only that but there are a lot of trolls lurking on the internet and they may even comment on your videos with something that doesn't even relate to your video topic. The best way I found to deal with negative comments, be from trolls or by people just disagreeing with my position on the matter was: Listen, Understand, Discuss, Improve and Thank your audience.Why do I say that? Believe or not, I answer to every single comment on my channel. Many times I turned someone that were completely against me into someone that later on even defended me from other negative comments. Many times you will not fully pass the message that was intended. Always keep an open communication channel with your audience because they will drive your views. Don't do it as to play a PR game but really listen and try to better yourself in every video. If you can not deal with critiques and keep a leveled mind when you receive a negative review, you may not be cut out for Youtube.&#x200B;Number 3: Think long term&#x200B;Can you keep your channel going on your content alone? What do I mean by that? Is your content wide enough to keep going long term? Is this content interesting enough to keep people following your channel or is it something that will only see random people walking in and out of the channel?The best way I found to combat that was to not get my apples from the same tree. For example, if you have a tech channel, don't stick to only equipment review but try to branch out to other areas like ""Best configurations for your PC"" etc. It also may help you to find subscribers from different niches to follow your channel.&#x200B;Number 4: Don't beat yourself up&#x200B;You uploaded your first video and you believed it would be a hit and bring you to stardom and after a week you got 20 views and only 3 subs.... That's ok! Sure, someone between your parents, 2 sisters and facebook friends doesn't love you. No worries, keep uploading. You have to remember that there are almost 8 billion people in the world and new channels are never appealing since people don't know if you are just here and then gone ,if you are here to stay or if your next content will match your last video. The worst you can do for yourself is to just give up when you hit a roadblock. It is like they say in the movie ""Field of Dreams"": If you build they will come... or in your case, If you make content they will subscribe. So while you need to be a critic, don't beat yourself up.&#x200B;Number 5: Keep it clean&#x200B;One of the worst thing you can do is build a channel, get subscribers and upload dozens of videos just to have your channel shut down because of Strikes. Always make sure to understand the Youtube rules and make sure not to use copyrighted material. At times you may receive a copyright check on your video or that the content is not suitable for most advertisers. If you know that is not the case, Fight it! A lot can have happened in those cases: For example: Youtube automatically believes you used copyrighted material. What could be the case but you could be still protected under the ""Fair use Laws"" or a channel simply wants to get a bite from your pie and if you don't notice the claim, you may be out of some of your revenue and not even notice. So if you know you are in the right, Fight it. Another very important thing is: Follow the right practices on Youtube. What do I mean by that? People will offer you sub4sub, they will try to sell you ""real subscribers, real views, etc. DON'T DO IT! Chances are Youtube will find out and you'll have your channel shut down. If you really want to grow in the correct way, use platforms like Facebook, Reddit, Sharree and Google Ads. Those will get you real views and real subscribers. While may take longer, those people will keep following you and give you real views that you can be proud of.&#x200B;Number 6: Learn from your failures&#x200B;Learn to read Youtube Studio Analytics. This will give you a good idea of what has worked and what haven't on your videos. But don't rush to it. Give a month on each video and look up your numbers. This will tell you from how many people subscribed because of a certain video, how much of a video was watched, the percentage of clicks by impression, etc. Some of those numbers, like for example ""clicks by impression"" are usually driven by your thumbnail and video title and not the video itself so you need to take all of this into account. While a click bait will give you a high percentage on those numbers, the percentage of the video watched time will be really low and you may even lose a potential subscriber or someone that is already subscribed.Also do your research on best upload times, best practices, etc. Trust me, Youtube is a lot of work.&#x200B;Number 7: Be yourself and have fun&#x200B;Sure in the beginning you will be inspired by another youtuber and may even in part emulate the same for a time. It's ok. But you need to find yourself.I best heard that from Jordy from Cinecom.net. He tells that in the beginning he was very serious and tried to pass his information on a very professional way. The channel did OK but only that. One day he decided to start been himself and not put a front and the CHANNEL EXPLODED! Now he got over 1 million subscribers and is one of the best channels on my list. And the best part.... Have fun!!! Youtube gives you the chance to connect with billions of people. Some of you may change lives because of your content. You may give people hope, dreams, support or even a laughter when they need it most. You may give information to people that wouldn't have it otherwise.And the best of all.... You will Inspire!&#x200B;So go foward.... create, inspire and make your lives extraordinary&#x200B;Thank you all for reading.";False;7 Main Things to Have Success on Youtube;https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/b4izef/7_main_things_to_have_success_on_youtube/

One that maybe we can start a petition for youtube to implement? The ability for youtubers to subscribe to and receive email notifications of individual playlists!You currently have the ability to subscribe to an entire channel, and once you're subscribed, you can click the bell icon to receive email notifications for that channel. However, there are plenty of channels that provide variety content, and those channels often have entire chunks of their subscriber base who are only interested in one type of content. My channel is one such variety channel.Because some of my fans are only interested in one type of content, they do not receive email notifications because they do not want their email inbox flooded with upload notifications they only have a 1 in 5 chance of actually caring about. This means that they often simply check my channel page every once in a while to see if I've uploaded any videos that interest them, dramatically increasing the chances that they might miss something.If, however, we had the ability to turn on notifications for individual playlists, fans would be much less hesitant to turn on said notifications. They would set up notifications for the series they want to follow, and never miss a single episode of those series, resulting in more views overall for the content creators.

Over the past couple of days, many people (including myself) have had their accounts terminated over hate speech without warning seemingly out of nowhere. There have been many posts on here over the past couple of days showing numerous examples of this. My account and many others were 5-10 years old and had serious amounts of time sunk into them. My activity in the weeks prior to being suspended was not any different than my activity at any point in the past ten years. I had no videos besides a few personal ones uploaded years past, and while I may have had some edgy comments posted from years and years ago I doubt they have anything significant enough to warrant a ban. People who uploaded the shooting or encouraged any type of behavior like that definitely deserve punishment. The problem is there seems to be a large amount of people were swept up out of the blue and didn't do anything along those lines. This is what leads me to believe that whatever youtube did may have accidentally blanket terminated people who checked some sort of key word in some aspect of their account even if that element was present before the shooting (for example my user name since 2015 or so was ""remove kebab"" , a meme the shooter used).I'm going through the normal means to get my account unbanned, I just thought that I would make this post to spread awareness and hopefully garner some attention towards the issue.www.youtube.com/user/thegangstajacktl;dr I think YouTube banned a bunch of people accidentally because they had something on their account which vaguely fulfilled some sort of algorithmic check box, even if they didn't do anything wrong.

I would like to start out by saying that my recommended page was fine up until recently. Specifically on mobile there were no video that were recommended to me that weren't related to my subscriptions (I only have 10 or so.) and although I would get unrelated video every once in a while it wasn't bad and I could ignore them. I didn't really have too much of an issue until I wiped my watch history from my YouTube channel. This is when I started getting videos completely unrelated to anything that I watch on this platform and every time I tried to press the ""I am not interested"" button there would be even more unrelated videos that I did not want watch including but not limited to, videos in another language I didn't understand(I'm in the US and that is what my location is set to.), sports highlights (Basketball and football were frequent), videos about make-up, among other videos I did not want to watch nor would I ever want to watch. Sometimes the videos that I had already said I wasn't interested in would reappear. &#x200B;This why I am writing this post. When I come here to this subreddit all I see are complaints about the recommended section of Youtube but none of the posts I have have actually suggested ideas to improve the section**(maybe there a few that I missed but when I used the search bar for this subreddit they didn't appear. If there are posts I missed please respond with the post that already did this I will delete this one or link to the posts that I missed)**. Now this complaints do have reasons for existing and in fact a majority of the complaints that I have seen regarding the recommended section are constructive. However, there aren't many that I have seen that offer solutions to the issues that are brought up by the criticisms of the section. &#x200B;In this post I will make a series of recommended fixes for these issues and I hope that whoever responds will add to this post. I also hope that this will be seen by YouTube's higher up and I hope that they will implement these suggestions to make the recommended section better. &#x200B;\-My first suggestion to fix the recommended section would be to have a completely separate menu so that users can customize their experience. This recommended section menu can have a country drop down menu so that only videos from a selected country will appear or it can have multiple drop down menus to allow for videos from multiple countries. Also if nothing has been selected in the recommended section menu, the recommended section should be based off of subscriptions and not watch history or a combination of subscriptions and watch history so that the user doesn't get videos he/she doesn't want to watch&#x200B;\-My second suggestion is have a sort by menu similar to how the search bar works. This one was actually brought up in a recent post that I saw asking for the recommended section to have a sort by popular option. I don't remember the name of the op and so I apologize for not having it but whomever it is I give full credit to you for this suggestion.&#x200B;\-My third suggestion would be to have a feature similar to desktop on mobile. The feature that I'm talking about is the ""grouping feature"". This feature basically groups together similar videos by topic. This would vastly improve the amount of effort needed to tell the algorithm ""I'm not interested in topic A"" because then the videos could either be selected one by one or selected by group to tell the algorithm that I'm not interested in this topic.&#x200B;So, what do you think of these suggestions? These are some that I just thought off the top of my head when I started writing this post. I'm sure that there are more that I am not thinking but I figured that anyone who wants to improve the platform will comment with more suggestions, critique my own suggestions or add on to the suggestions I already mentioned above.  &#x200B;&#x200B;  ";False;Ideas for the recommended videos section of YouTube;https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/b46bqr/ideas_for_the_recommended_videos_section_of/

I rarely even bother monetizing many of my videos because they are usually so short that an ad seems inappropriate. Here's a short example. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u1RegHNhqpY  I want to say an algorithm detected some videos like this and figured I was just uploading other people's videos so they demonetized my channel. If that's the case, then I should be able to reapply for monetization privileges in 30 days without worry, because then a human will be reviewing, and they'll be able to see any of the algorithmically flagged videos were false positives.Or, another possibility I'm thinking is that I have too many videos that have copyright claims, even though they are not DMCA takedowns. Youtube says having these sort of claims doesn't affect your account standing but maybe it does now? I have lots of content either with copyright claims either by content ID, or from someone manually claiming it. I typically leave those alone unless I'm sure it qualifies as fair use. Sometimes I don't do much editing on a video and figure it's not ""transformative"" enough so I don't bother disputing the claim. I even have a few gameplay videos which have music and I'm sure it's not justifiable as fair use and I don't even bother trying to monetize those in the first place.What do you guys think?

Few Months ago I requested take down of some videos on YouTube which were reuploaded without permission, recorded on event without permission, stolen from our facebook page and pre-uploaded before release without permission. In our that specific video there was a celebrity. He was an Bangladeshi Sports Athlete. We hired him for our event and recorded his motivational speech. Which is our original content. But as I said before, it was stolen from our Facebook page and uploaded before release on another channel and after release, when it went viral it was also reuploaded in several channels. That's why to protect our video, I requested for several take downs and a content id tool to keep our content safe. But I think there has been a big misunderstanding. You guys have terminated our account instead of helping us. Please reinstate the account and take down the flase uploads and give a content id tool for support. It is a matter of copyright. Our video was national sensation and a religious peace message, nothing unethical. We didn't submitted any fraudulent information in youtube's legal waveforms.

And my most viewed video is at 370-ish (Im only a couple weeks into my channel).

It would usually take the video all week to reach 100, but this one hit 250 in 5 days, and had 100 by the end of day 1. And I was honestly really excited and proud to see this growth (Ik, Im lame).

Especially one whos honest and isnt cheating views. On the first day, the rise in views was random. So I thought Id capitilize on it and do a ton of time expensive promotion. Did Youtube, see my spike in views and suspect I was fishy or something? Have you had views drop then comeback?

In this case, the 10 hour long video should work then.Does anyone know the work-around with this issue?From my understanding of reading other posts, after a video is uploaded, there is a processing, which youtube then formats the 8 resolution sizes for the video.It did take awhile to process, but the process step has already been completed before publishing.&#x200B;&#x200B;I currently use Davinci Resolve, and exported in the recommended settings based on Davinci resolve (switching from Quicktime to .Mp4) to export in .MP4 file format.I also have HandBrake, which was the initial upload of the 6:30 hour long video.";False;4k UHD Video Not shown as 2160p, but as 360p;https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/b3uh34/4k_uhd_video_not_shown_as_2160p_but_as_360p/

TL;DR at the bottom!# A Brief HistoryMy channel is a few years old. At first it was a supplement to my Twitch livestreams. I uploaded clips and eventually made some exclusive content revolving around the video game I was playing. Every once in a while I would upload a cat video or a review of some product just because. My videos usually reached high 3-digit, low 4-digit views with some mid 5-digit view clips every once in a while. I was approved for monetization before it was heavily branded as the ""YouTube Partnership Program"", before the subscriber and watch-hour threshold was introduced. I was making a few bucks for my efforts, and I jumped back and forth between MCN's before eventually just sticking to a 1 on 1 relationship with YouTube for my earnings.My first video blew up in 2016 and had nothing to do with my regular uploads. I had messed around with VFX software and superimposed Cthulhu knocking down the Willis Tower in Chicago over some old footage of a tornado siren in a rain storm. That video is now creeping close to 3 million views. Of course this spurred a change in my uploads, and pushed me to exclusively create these monster attacking videos. I've made more Cthulhu clips, some UFO clips, sea monsters, dragons, Godzilla, you name it, all participating in various pandemonic activities. I threw together ""top 5"" videos of my own content. My subscriber count climbed steadily, and my total channel view count was approaching 10 million. People were stealing my content left and right, including my unaltered clips in their own compilations, and 100% of my copyright strikes were approved within hours. Some of those offenders apologized and offered to attribute proper credit. These people are now some of my best internet friends. Everything was coasting well.# The DemonetizationMy channel survived through the adpocalypse, and I managed to retain a perfect channel standing, despite the malicious efforts of a select few. In December of 2018, I noticed that my estimated earnings for the past 28 days was dropping, and by quite a bit. Normally I expect a fluctuation of a few dollars per week but I was losing tens of dollars every day. I went to my enabled features page on YouTube and saw that my monetization was disabled, and had been so for 10 days. I never received a notification or email, so honestly my first thought was that I had been hacked or something. Upon further investigation, I discovered that this was done purposefully by YouTube, citing that I had violated the community guidelines. Their reason was cited as ""**misleading metadata**"". The claim was that my videos or my metadata was misleading in order to trick people into giving me views (this is my own paraphrasing, I don't recall the exact verbiage. I'm sure it can be found in the community guidelines). No specifics were offered, not which video(s) were in violation or if it was reported or anything. On top of this, I was unable to reapply for monetization for 30 days as of the demonetization. Since I only found this 10 days into my demonetizaiton, I would have to wait another 20 to reapply.At first I figured this might be a mistake, but to be safe I went through all of my videos and removed any tags that might be misconstrued as misleading. Anywhere I had mentioned the word ""real"" in these VFX videos, I removed. I removed any synonyms that might miss the mark too much (for example, I removed ""sea monster"" from Godzilla clips). The most frustrating part of all of this was that other channels were doing the exact same thing as me, some using OTHER people's content without permission or credit attribution, and were still monetized. At this point, I was pretty sure that my demonetization was erroneous.# The ReapplicationAfter my 20 days, in early January 2019, I reapplied for monetization. The reapplication process is literally clicking a button that says ""Reapply"". There is no form to plead a case or include any information at all. After clicking the magic button, my monetization page forwarded to a page with 5 or so sentences, including the quip that the application was said to take ""about a month"". I hardly uploaded around this time because my motivation was gone. I created a couple of clips just to keep the channel afloat while this was all going on. About half way through this wait time, one of my top 5 videos EXPLODED. I went from 2-10 thousand views per day to well over **100,000 views per day**. This was probably the most frustrated I had felt in a long time. I was losing sleep over missing out on hundreds of dollars over this nonsense and it was infuriating. I started really taking this issue seriously at this point, and did some research on what I could possibly do, until I came across the TeamYouTube twitter.This account seemed to be helpful for a handful of larger creators and I figured I would give it a shot. I tweeted at them, and they actually responded within a day. They asked for a screenshot of my analytics page, which I provided, and got no response. I started over with them a few days later, and they responded with the same message that I was reading: here is the community guideline that you are reported to be violating. I pleaded my case that this may be erroneous, and the twitter account said they would forward it to someone for me. Finally, some hope! I waited a week or so with no update, until a change was made to my monetization page...# The Verdict... In late January, 2019, my reapplication for remonetization had been denied. This time, however, the reason cited was no longer misleading metadata, but instead: ""**Reused Content""**. I was floored by this, at no point had I used anyone else's content in any of my videos. All of my top 5's were my own clips, and all of my clips were of my own creation. Maybe using my videos again in top 5's is what YouTube is referring to? But other channels do this all the time. While yes, the monsters were superimposed over footage that I found online, this is extremely transformative in nature and falls well under the guise of fair use. The precedent had been set for this as I had countless successful claims of my own, as well as denied strikes against my channel from others. YouTube's new reasoning here is only half of my frustration; why is YouTube switching up their reasons for demonetizing like this? It is as though they are just randomly assigning issues to my channel that don't exist to keep me from monetizing. Again, they do not provide specifics as to how I am violating guidelines, which videos are doing it, if it was the source of user reports, or anything specific at all. As with the previous demonetization, this one allowed me to reapply. So again, I waited until I could try once more.# The Re-ReapplicationIn mid February 2019, I was able to click the magic button again. This time around, my analytics page did not forward me to that 5 sentence text page, but instead to the page that you see when you first apply for monetization, which I thought was peculiar. This is the page that has the green check marks next to the thresholds for applying for monetization. I tweeted at team YouTube again just for good measure and got no response. At this point I had been reading forum posts on Reddit and Google Help forums, most recently citing applications taking over 3 months. I figured since I was able to procure help from TeamYouTube last time, I got lucky and my application was reviewed really quickly, and that this time I would be out of luck. 30 days passed, and this seemed to be the case. I had not gotten any answer yet. At this point I pretty much gave up, and considered moving on from creating for YouTube.# The Verdict II, ReloadedI had admittedly been ignoring my earnings page at this point. There was no point in checking as every day it just said $0.00. In mid March, 2019, I decided to take a peak at my enabled features page on a whim, and SURPRISE, MY MONETIZATION WAS *ENABLED*! I just about had a heart attack, I thought maybe I was misreading what feature was enabled on my page. I checked my earnings page, and sure enough, I had been earning for the past 7 days! Again, no notification or email from YouTube, just a quiet remonetization, available for every single one of my uploads. No yellow dollar signs.The moral of the story here is at the end of the day, YouTube creators have exactly 0 control and one should avoid treating the platform as a right instead of a privilege. You can do everything right and follow the guidelines as closely as you feasibly can, and your channel can still lose monetization for several months, or perhaps indefinitely, for whatever unenforced reason.Hopefully this story has helped or inspired those on a similar path, and to not give up hope! I'm happy to answer any questions in the comments.**TL;DR:** Demonetized (what I believe to be erroneously) for ""misleading metadata"". Reapplied unceremoniously, and was denied again for ""reused content"" (again, erroneously). Didn't change anything, applied a third time and was reinstated.

I've been working hard to make the video fit for kids by trying to keep your rules. if I have broken these rules, it was unintentionally and I apologize. What I think is that I've probably tried to make youtube friends by commenting on their videos. Some of my comments were copy paste, and maybe that might be misunderstood. just to be practical I wrote in this form. and again, this has been done inadvertently and will not be repeated. I am also reading your rules for a while to not repeat the same mistake. My channel has no copyright issues, sexual content, or incitement to violence, and so on.

YouTube, to me, lately has been the same dopamine-craving, empty, void of any meaning social media that Facebook and Snapchat already were. I don't get any joy out of being addicted on YouTube anymore. **And it's all due to being unable to find videos that I care for anymore.**I have an older YouTube account that I hadn't been using anymore for the last 5 years. I went back on it to go through my watch history to get nostalgic, and one thing immediately stood out to me: my watch history back then is completely different from what my current watch history is! And I don't mean specific videos or that I have different interests now, I mean that **my current watch history is way more monotone: the same people, the same channels, over and over again.**I started watching some of those old videos again: a lot of them were obscure **with less than a 100k views or even only thousands of views today.** But all of them were of much better quality creative wise and in terms of variety.And it got me thinking: why? How did I find these videos back then, a lot of them classics that I hold dear to my heart, and **why can't I find those kinds of videos anymore**? I mean, back then I wasn't actively searching niche videos, yet I still found them, whereas today, I can't.And that's when I saw the recommendations next to the video that I was watching. The video that I was watching was obscure and old; a Japanese song that was ripped from nicovideo. Back in the days when I found this video, **the recommended videos would have had something to do with that Japanese video - either based on title, the current channel or the tags from the videos.** This meant it was easy for me to find more videos like this, regardless how obscure that video was. **View counts, verified statuses and video time- those all didn't matter.**But now - that same video has the most bland, generic and godawful recommendations next to it. **There is not a single video in that list that has something to do with the current video.** It's all ""Saturday Night Live"" (which I never even watch), ""Game Grumps"" (which I do watch frequently but has NOTHING to do with the video), or that one clickbait video that seems to get recommended to everyone for months regardless of interests.It doesn't matter which video I chose, it doesn't matter how often I refresh te page and it doesn't even matter if I clear my recommendations. The list stays roughly the same for everything, forever. **I can't find new videos anymore. I can only see channels I liked in the past or that others ""like me"" like.**And just like that YouTube's machine learning has sucked me into my bubble. I can't find opposing videos anymore without actively searching for them and even then YouTube doesn't put those videos at the top, **I can't find niche videos anymore because those don't make YouTube any money** and I sure as hell can't even find any old videos I've watched  that are hidden deep down in my Search History (which btw, still doesn't have any sort or filtering system) **since YouTube just acts like I've never watched those kinds of videos** \- no no, watch some of these bland and sh\*t videos instead that generate us heaps of cash, whether you like it or not.The thing that hurts me the most is that **I know these niche types of content is still being made**. I'll just never, ever be able to find them anymore thanks to YouTube itself.The giant database of interesting videos is being dumbed down because a system thinks it knows me better than I do - or that acts on its own bias to only get money out of me, whatever the cost.YouTube lost the thing that made it great - and there's not even a good alternative to YouTube which makes it only sadder. I guess that means there's no point for me to go to YouTube anymore except for maybe occasionally checking my subs.I hope I'm not the only one who feels annoyed at YouTube for their way of running things nowadays. There are lots of problems with their copyright system, demonetisation system and - still ongoing, but less bad - ElsaGate stuff, that stuff like this never really seem to get as much attention.

So I did a 2 hour long reading of the manifesto of the New Zealand shooter, where I debunked this racial neo-nazi ideology. If anyone would have watched it for a few minutes they would have noticed that it was not in any way breaking guidelines, it was not promoting hatred quite the opposite. I went through the manifesto and debunked his hateful message pointing out that most of his theories did not make sense nor did they even reflect the society we live in, and said in the end that I would never want to live in a society the manifesto advocates.So I received an email saying I broke the guidelines, but I did not receive a strike on the video, so I could not even give a complaint. The video was taken down period, that's that. I don't make any money on youtube and I don't really care and there were not many views on the video, but I just found it a bit odd that youtube has taken steps that feels like they just using a shotgun to take down videos just in case. The email said it was reviewed, but I have hard time seeing that anyone spent any time on it as in just a few minutes it would have been quite clear that I do not in any way agree with the shooter.I just think that going in this direction will make it really hard talking about any kind of issues on Youtube. It is censorship, even though I don't think that there are bad intentions on behalf of Youtube to do this. Youtube is a private company that can do what it likes on its platform, but being a long term Youtube user I've noticed a trend of Youtube moving towards a platform that only caters ad-friendly content, everything else is irrelevant.I don't care about what happens to the video (it is boring and long not like a great video in terms of quality, editing etc. however the message could not be clearer), but I think I do have a valid point on the direction of how social media censorship has become so mindless that nobody bothers to even check if a video is offensive or not, why not just ban it just in case.&#x200B;Sincerely disappointed youtuber";False;Youtube filtering New Zealand content;https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/b2wxci/youtube_filtering_new_zealand_content/

The shitposting and the irony-as-misdirection, the ""subscribe to Pewdiepie"", the sign he made at the court; all this is loose in the Internet, and everyone, especially lonely kids addicted to likes and memes are fertile soil to the hate behind it. 9gag has taught me that memes come loaded in politics and often in ideology. First, when seeing a new meme, you don't quite ""get it"". Then you see it again and getting traction. You begin to laugh at it.

It is a noble goal. But this blanket approach of disabling filters to make it hard to find this particular video is having the opposite effect.

To be seen by many, to earn him notoriety. What he didn't expect was to literally change the world/Internet. The way Facebook, Youtube, Google have responded - the ways these search efforts, in an effort to combat him, have actually played 100% into his hands by taking what would have been a brief, dark curiosity for some and actually amplified this to an international story that has branched far beyond the scope of the tragedy as major companies bend over backwards to enact censorship and broad stroke methods that effect millions.This has ultimately changed the narrative from being just another mass shooter who'd have his 15 minutes and be forgotten about in a week to a mass shooter who froze the Internet and impacted everyone and shaped many different discourses for weeks, none of which are relevant to the tragedy and all of which detract from what everyone should be taking about: how to stop these shootings from happening. The only lesson YouTube, Facebook and Google are teaching is: if you're going to shoot over 40 people, make sure you're livestreaming it, so the big companies stop the Internet in its tracks and force everyone to pay attention.I worry about what these misguided efforts to combat these shooters will wrought in the future... but I'm convinced this is the wrong way to do it.

This will get hard to explain as wont mention specifics, but I will do my best. Also throw away account. I have a YouTube channel based around tutorials and learning for a specific piece of software. It grew it fairly successfully for around 6 years up to around 23k subs. I was never super active at putting up videos, was around once a month sometimes longer (most start with sorry it's been so long). I think because of the fairly good quality I was producing people didn't seem to mind. But, the videos I made tended to be quite long and normally required a fair amount of prep, and then a full day or two to complete. They often even ended in failure and scrappage meaning a waste of a couple of days (I'm terrible for the tweaking to perfection thing). Then, about a year and a half ago, I had a quite drastic change in circumstances. Twins arrived, and I didn't have full days for making videos anymore. I pretty much didn't get any thing done for the channel at all. Now I don't want to abandon it completely, as I would love to return to the subject one day when I have some free time, but that will be a while away yet. However, to scratch the making videos itch, I created new channel that was based on a different technology. Similar branding, sharing the naming that I always use, just with the new technologies name on the end of the existing name. The videos on this one are not so much about learning, more interesting things with the occasional larger project or advice based on something I have discovered inside of the hobby. The two do meet, in as much as you can utilise the originally mentioned software for this new subject but they aren't specifically connected (what I meant by difficult to explain whilst being vague). The videos for this channel are MUCH easier to create as there is less prep involved and editing is much easier. This means I am able to create them more frequently, even with the girls eating most of my time. Currently I am able to create 1 - 2 videos a week and I would say while different to the other videos, they are of similar quality and retain my 'style' (shudder).  The thing is, the new channel is being quite slow to pick up traction, in around 4 months it is now up to 55 subs. I understand that it takes time (I did it before) but I am also wondering if I am wasting what I have done already. Should I start uploading the videos from the new channel to the larger channel. Perhaps even create a transition announcement video first? Then schedule them over the next few months. I currently have 12 short videos (2 - 3 mins) and 5 longer videos (20 - 40mins). I am just a bit worried about upsetting the current subscribers. How should I approach it? Should I not cross contaminate  at all? Should I just refocus and get on with it assuming I will lose some and make some new?  Has anyone else here been in this situation, and if so how did it pan out?I'm possibly making a big thing over nothing, but so much has gone into building the existing channel, I need to at least think about this.;False;Advice on changing content on fairly large YouTube channel;https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/b2h9k4/advice_on_changing_content_on_fairly_large/

Because right now I feel like I'm almost a second class citizen when watching the videos, because I give absolutely nothing to the creators when consuming their content. If the $5 from my subscription was getting split evenly among the people whom I watch based off of playtime that would feel very fair and incentivise creators to suggest paying for premium.

No revenue since then. I own and created my dream Automotive Digital Media Company BoostLust lda here in Portugal, Europe where I live, and let me start by saying a few things.I own commercial rights for the clips I use on BoostLust YouTube Channel ( they have been submited to me, with T&C ), have an amazing relationship with the community involved, have created an amazing fan base that loves the way I edit the videos and the value I add to them, either entertainment or educational or both.I'm now taking art classes to improve my editing skills. I haven't made voiceovers yet for health reasons. still, I'm getting better and better day by day on editing. 2018 was a tough year, been sick most of the time. 2019 I started going in and out of hospital. One of my dogs got sick, they are everything to me. and Youtube does this. There's HUNDREDS of channels downloading and reuploading my exact same videos and even thumbnails. and there's hundreds of people using clips I've used, but without proper rights, and they don't even edit the videos, don't add value to nothing, just do it to gain money. With youtube revenue I was paying for my dogs, helping my family, paying medical stuff, paying school, paying the business expenses of BoostLust lda, paying my own bills and food, and thinking and dreaming about expanding it even further, with close relationship with the comunnity i've created, the BoostSquad family. I've tried everything, on twitter, several times, emails, everything. Youtube don't reply. I've been waiting for 4 months, almost 5. It's been a living hell, not just about money, but everything, BUT obviously having my source of income cut for almost 5 months with SO MUCH stuff going on, makes it 10x worst.I could link the channels that are 100% just downloading my stuff and reuploading ( have reported them but got no response too ) but i think I'd got flagged as spam here. www.youtube.com/channel/UCnOscw7i4qgKH47Wq9lhAcg for example only uploading my stuff, theres a lot more. a LOT.I hope someone from Youtube can see this and get this to the right person and hopefully aprove me for YPP. I'm really doing my best in the worst situations, I couldn't even made it to edit a video in 2019. I can't take it anymore, please someone from YouTube review my channel, ask me all the questions, anything. I just want to get back on my feet and keep pursuing my dream and turning my life around. thank you again.Matt, from BoostLust.My channel is www.youtube.com/BoostLust;False;My Whole Channel Was Mistakenly Demonetized.

It turns out that they were finding the fandom page for the relevant topic and reading from it verbatim, rather than doing their own research and writing an original script.  No credit was given to the fandom team who wrote the pages that were used, despite multiple editors asking him to, if he wont stop copying their work, at least credit them.  Since Fandom is a public site which can be edited freely by anyone, can any ownership be claimed by anyone? Since there is technically no one single creator who is being plagiarised from?  Is this sort of use fandom sites to create youtube videos against TOS? And if so, is there anything i can do, as someone who hasnt personally contributed to any of the pages in question,  to help prevent such use happening in the future?Hope my post kinda makes sense I tend to ramble a lot so yeah, just wondering if this sort of use is fine or if something should be done about it?
