I'd like to share a tool I recently wrote to help delete my own messages on a slack workspace. I was successfully able to use [slack-cleaner](https://github.com/kfei/slack-cleaner) to remove older files, and older messages from a number of channels,. However, I found slack-cleaner to be bit painful to discover which channels to remove messages from, and it doesn't do much to retry on failures.To solve the first issue, slack's search is pretty useful for finding messages prior to a certain date for a given user.  So after a little bit of coding and testing, I've made my tool available which should be able to run in the background and clean up any old messages of yours.If you think this might be useful to you, give `deslackify` a go, and please let me know what you think:https://github.com/bboe/deslackifyIt requires python to run, can be installed via `pip install deslackify`, and then run via:    deslackify --token TOKEN --before YYYY-MM-DD USERNAMEFor example, if I wanted to delete all my messages prior to 2018 I could run it via:    deslackify --token TOKEN --before 2018-01-01 bboeThanks!;False;Another tool to help remove slack messages;https://www.reddit.com/r/Slack/comments/au5i0h/another_tool_to_help_remove_slack_messages/

Now I'm not saying slack is horrible or worthless, or anything like that. It has its place, and there is benefit to my client. They were very firewalled before (there's no actual office, people work from home in multiple countries). But for me, as a contractor, I find it incredibly difficult to find the requests I need. Previously, people would email me with requests. It was simple to track, I knew where everything was, and it was fine. Now, I literally spend more time trying to find posts/files/conversations than I do on the actual work (they have dozens of channels). When I miss something, they say ""oh, didn't you see that in that channel?"" I'm contracted for 20 hours a week, and I'm spending 25-30 hours a week now, and I'd say 5 of that is just messing with slack. I could probably spend 10 hours a week just reading slack and still not be fully up to date. So my question, is there a way to unslack? Like convert slack messages into emails? Not a combined review email, but like as someone sends something across, I'd get an email that looked like it was from them or had their name prepended to the subject line [for sorting purposes]. With files attached.  And if I replied back, it would go into the correct slack conversation? And maybe without having to talk to the admin? I'm trying to be supportive of slack to them, but it's just not working for me. Again, not looking to make anyone defensive about slack, it's just not working for me.

You could send someone a hipchat and if they don't go to their computer untill the next day the desktop notification will still be visible on screen with the message content untill they physically click on hipchat and it will disappear.I've had feedback from our older genuration workers saying they keep missing messages because it's not clear they have been sent one after not being on at their PC for a few mins.

We're talking more than half a million messages. Why Skype, you might ask. Because Skype has this really nice local database where all the messages are kept, which I as a programmer can use to make all sorts of cool statistics and stuff. Sadly, this local database feature is going away with newest version of Skype, so we are being forced to move elsewhere.**So my questions are:** Would Slack be a good alternative for us? Is it easy to retrieve our messaging history? Will we be able to import our old Skype conversation? Would we have to pay because of a certain 10 000 message limit I keep reading about?If Slack is not the best option for us, maybe you know some other instant messaging platform which would suit us?

The purpose of the workspace is to foster discussion and networking among the students. However, it has been difficult to stimulate activity. A big problem is that there is a learning curve to using Slack, and I believe that many of the members are not even receiving notifications for the messages that are sent in the group. Is there any solution to this? I thought of integrating the workspace with their emails so they get a weekly update email on messages/discussions in the workspace in their email inboxes (which they check regularly). Hopefully, this would increase activity on the workspace. I found an app called Digest.AI but it doesn't seem to work or be supported anymore.
