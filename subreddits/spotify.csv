I was super excited because our last release got featured on Mellow Morning which had about 350k followers and Fresh Finds has over 650k! So needless to say I was expecting some big numbers. Mellow morning was netting us about 10k streams a day or more for quite a while. However in the few days that we’ve been on Fresh Finds we’ve got a much more underwhelming amount of streams than expected. Down to less than 2k streams a day. Our track is earlier on the playlist than it was on mellow morning as well. So they way I see it Fresh Finds must be a very dead playlist with hundreds of thousands of dead subscribers or I’m caught in some glitch. Maybe my song is just hot garbage...who knows!

Back in October or November, Spotify rolled out an update that featured this ""Lightning bolt"" that would stick to the top right of your screen while on the ""Home"" section. This lightning bolt was basically an improved Release Radar, in which it would constantly update as a new song/album would release from an artist that you followed. No more waiting until Friday to know if one of your followed artists dropped a new song, this ""lightning bolt"" that I am referring to would update every single time that one of your followed artists released a new track, and would give more in depth information about the exact date in which it was released, along with all the other songs below it that released the days prior. Secondly, the way that albums were presented was far superior than the Release Radar. As you know, when an artist that you follow releases an album, only one of the songs will be on the Release Radar playlist. With the lightning bolt,  the album would seemingly be presented just as a normal track, with the name of the album featured, but when you clicked on the album, it would provide another drop down menu in which it lists all the tracks within the album. This was such an amazing feature that only seemed to have lasted in the UI for about a week until it was taken out and it just sort of makes me question why.

I have a feeling the answer on this is going to be ""no"" but I have to ask just in case...So basically I'm looking for a Spotify player that is both lightweight and can play the songs off your hard-drive that Spotify downloads rather than use bandwidth to stream them.My reasoning: like many of us I'm sure, I play a lot of video games. Recently the amount of resources that Spotify is taking up is getting a little out of hand. It's gotten to the point for me that even when I'm running it in offline mode, when I close the program I notice both my internet speed and FPS increase. I've tried a few programs so far that claim to be able to play Spotify songs including Clementine and Fidelify, but it seems that both of them are not currently working (they won't load in playlists; common issue afaik). I've tried both the Windows app store and the regular versions of the official Spotify program (I'm running Windows 10). I've rebooted and reinstalled these several times and even contacted Spotify over Twitter (to which I got the usual try reinstalling the program), but have found no solutions as of yet (other than run the whole thing on a Raspberry Pi and plug it into my sound card as an overlaying source).

I've looked around and seen a few other reddit posts with this problem- does anyone have any ideas?Secondly, spotify is now ridiculously slow. It can take well over a minute to load the home screen, and it does not seem to be affected by the wifi strength. It often fails to load completely and I end up having to restart the app. Often when I pause a song, the music continues for many minutes until it actually stops, and there is a similar problem for selecting songs. Even when offline, I can't get a downloaded album to load quickly. It's really annoying, and I didn't have any of these problems before I got premium.I tried reinstalling the app a while ago (to no effect) but since then I have downloaded a bunch of albums so I'm hesitant to try that again. I've updated to the newest version, and tried all sorts of things. I'm pretty irritated considering that I'm PAYING for this.

Whenever I see a band celebrating one of their album's birthdays on Instagram, I always give that album a listen, if for no other reason than to revisit some albums I haven't listened to in awhile. For awhile, I've been wanting to make a service that shows you all of your favorite albums' birthdays, and last night at a hackathon, I sat down for about six hour and made one.To use Albumversary, head over to [the website](https://albumversary.com/) and sign in with your Spotify account. Once that's done, you'll be given a link that will work in any calendaring application (I use the built-in Calendar app on my iPhone and Mac, but it'll work on Android, Windows, Linux, the web, and pretty much anywhere else you can think of). Once the calendar is added to your favorite app, you're done! Whenever you refresh the calendar, it'll automatically pull your latest favorite albums and update the calendar appropriately.As this service was made in about 6 hours, there's still a lot of work to be done. I plan on adding some features over the next few weeks, but interested parties with some coding knowledge can check out the project [on GitHub](https://github.com/nrubin29/albumversary) and contribute code. There's a TODO list there with some features I plan to implement.Albumversary will be 100% free, ad-free, and open source, forever.Please leave any feedback below, and I hope you enjoy Albumversary!\--Credit to u/Nick337Games for the website design.;False;Albumversary: Get a custom calendar of your favorite albums' birthdays;https://www.reddit.com/r/spotify/comments/b2bps3/albumversary_get_a_custom_calendar_of_your/
