I need some help with an Excel formula for work (I work in shipping). Basically, from the day a vessel arrives into port, we allow customers 6 free days before we start charging storage. So, if a vessel was to call today 24.03.2019, the customer's last free day would be 29.03.2019. However, some customers get extra free days, so I need a cell in the sheet where I can write in the number of free days a customer has, but by default it will be 6. Now, storage is charged in tiers as follows:day 1-6 freeday 7-13 £15/dayday 14-20 £30/dayday 21+ £45/dayThose prices are charged on a 20' container. The price doubles on a 40' container, so the formula would have to take this into account. Also, for those customers with special agreements, once their free days are up, they are charged according to the tiered format. That is to say, if a customer has a special agreement for 15 free days, and the vessel calls 24/03/2019, and they request delivery on 16/04/2019, then the charges should look like this:24/03/2019 - 29/03/2019 free30/03/2019 - 05/04/2019 free(06/04/2019)08/04/2019 - 12/04/2019 - £15013/04/2019 - 16/04/2019 - £180It also should be broken down like above, as that needs to be included on the invoice.

I even got PMs asking specifics around the design.Since then, I also launched a YouTube channel, where I show how to create dynamic charts.The latest video is a bit more special. In it, I explain and demonstrate how to create a complete Excel Dashboard. More specifically - an Actual vs. Budget Travel Cost Dashboard.Since a lot of you were interested in the design of the Templates, I though it'd by a good idea to share it with you: [https://youtu.be/rBuiBNZWjE4](https://youtu.be/rBuiBNZWjE4)Also, the Dashboard from the video is provided to download for free. The link is in the video description. Feel free to play around with it and use it in you work!I know there are many videos showing how to build dashboards, but I believe that everyone does it a little bit differently and have a unique way of doing it.

I just want to edit the name by which the loop saves files.I'll give a quick description of what it is *currently* doing.  Basically it loops a set of actions for a defined range of rows, here A2:A72. There is a 'main' workbook where this loop is done where all the input data for the individual templates is collected. Each row is a separate subject's input data and is copy/pasted into a template in a different workbook. Solver is then run to adjust the template for the given input data. Then it saves and names the file based on the text in the first cell of the row that was copy/pasted. (ie A2,A3,A4,etc..) It then loops this for every row and every row will have its own template set up and saved separately.This is ALMOST how I ideally want it to work.I just want it save the File name not just as A2, but as =C2&"" -  ""&A2I tried using this that was suggested by someone>fName = Range(""C"" & c.Row) & Range(""A"" & c.Row)But when I tried I would get a Method SaveAs error. On the watch view I could see it was because it wasn't reading the fName so it was just the file path in the script value. I changed it back to c.Value and then it started working by naming the file as the A column cell.  Admittedly, I don't really understand how c.Value is returning column A which makes it harder for me to figure out how to modify it to get what I want.Anyway here is the script as I currently have it:>Sub RunModels()  >  >Dim fPath As String  >  >Dim strTemplate As String  >  >Dim fName As String  >  >Dim wb As Workbook  >  >Dim c As Range  >  >Dim rngLoop As Range  >  >'Where will files get stored?  >  >fPath = ""H:\\ACQUISITIONS\\Personal (D-AP)\\Gmo\\ALL MF""  >  >'Where is the template file?  >  >strTemplate = ""H:\\ACQUISITIONS\\Personal (D-AP)\\Gmo\\ALL MF\\Garden Grove - 11121 Chapman Ave.xlsm""  >  >'Error check  >  >If Right(fPath, 1) <> Application.PathSeparator Then  >  >fPath = fPath & Application.PathSeparator  >  >End If  >  >Application.ScreenUpdating = False  >  >'Set Loop  >  >Set rngLoop = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(""Sheet1"").Range(""A2:A72"")  >  >'Set Looped Actions  >  >For Each c In rngLoop.Cells  >  >'Open the template file  >  >Set wb = [Workbooks.Open](https://Workbooks.Open)(strTemplate)  >  >'Add some data to the template file  >  >c.EntireRow.Copy Destination:=wb.Worksheets(""Insert Sheet"").Range(""A2"")  >  >SolverOk SetCell:=""$H$20"", MaxMinVal:=3, ValueOf:=1.2, ByChange:=""$F$35"", \_  >  >Engine:=1, EngineDesc:=""GRG Nonlinear""  >  >SolverSolve  >  >'Dynamic File Naming  >  >fName = c.Value  >  >'Save the file and close  >  >wb.SaveAs Filename:=wb.Path & Application.PathSeparator & fName  >  >wb.Close  >  >Next c  >  >Application.ScreenUpdating = True  >  >End Sub&#x200B;Thank you very very much for all and any help!!";False;VBA: How to get a (more) dynamic file name;https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/b3snke/vba_how_to_get_a_more_dynamic_file_name/

What this 'metrics' file is attempting to do is pull the data from those files (through the use of COUNTIF statements, not sure if that's relevant), and count up the number of charges that are out there (by day) as well as the number resolved (again, by day).When the files are open I get values just fine, the equations work like they're supposed to, but if I close them and recalculate (either through F9 or by entering a new value in a cell), all cells of the affected closed document change to #VALUE.When I reopen the files, they change from #VALUE to the expected values.I can't figure out why.  Is it a network access thing?  Like suddenly Excel has lost the ability to independently access these files?  It's never been an issue before.* When I go into ""Edit Links"" it tells me the links are ""OK"".* These are shared files, but I tried unsharing them (""old"" share, we don't use the shitty cloud sharing system) they still didn't work.Any ideas?";False;COUNTIF statement giving #VALUE to a linked shared drive file, only when the file is closed.;https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/b3uif7/countif_statement_giving_value_to_a_linked_shared/

I initially thought it would just be an easy IF and/or RANK formula to automatically adjust positions and thereby cumulative points of each driver. Turns out that I was greatly mistaken. I started by copying over the table from Wikipedia after the first race in Australia. You can find that [here]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Formula_One_World_Championship#World_Drivers'_Championship_standings). I thought that I would have to in the cell(s) that show the final points) just do a simple `=IF(C2=1, -1)+25` so the ‘Points’ column would read 25 for Pos. 1. However, the fastest lap also gets an additional 1 point added to their total points earned in the race. Please see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Formula_One_World_Championship#Scoring_system) for the scoring system. That makes things kind of difficult as I want the ‘drivers’ column to automatically adjust after each race so at the end of the season it shows the final standings.So then I tried doing a `RANK` formula but I do not know what to input for number,order,ref so that it adjusts the positions in the drivers’ column according to their positions in each specific race. I don’t mind if the column for each race (the next one is in Bahrain) is jumbled w/r/t the driver’s finished position, i.e. it read; 1, 3, 7, 5, 4, 9, 2, 10 etc. I’m sure that I can probably fix this later. Ideally, I want to input the driver’s position in the race in the race column and it adjusts the points and the driver’s position in the position column. The position column would be generated due to the cumulative points earned. I have generated an example table of what I would like the spreadsheet to end up looking like though I do not know how to include the additional 1 point gained for the fastest lap yet. I guess I mean to say that the Driver column and Pos. column should adjust according to the cumulative points earned after I input the results of each driver after each race.Thank you so much!

All the different classifications, with how much sales they have lost/gained. Last 4 weeks. Last 8 weeks. Prior week. Ect This sheet attached https://imgur.com/a/zZEHlYD is my first go at it. Facing issues of converting this into a pivot table. Also I have to add data to this every week to update it. The original data comes from data base form but using an initial pivot table I converted it as per the image attached. How can I achieve this without running out of memory? I tried vlookup of the classifications back into the original database data but memory issues creeping up. Is there simpler way of doing this in excel. Im aware of python and sql ect but this is not an option at this point.

My question is: is their a way I can add conditions to this macro without directly coding them in?My ideal process would be a program that lets me upload an excel file (the packing list), lets me select the right client, press a button and then the new workbook comes rolling out.In this program I also would want to be able to add conditions and maybe even add something so they could make a new macro without hardcoding anything.What would be the best solution for this problem?

One thing I can't stand doing anymore is creating 2 different pivot tables from 2 different data sources and then connecting them on another tab using vlookups.For instance, I typically get data from an ad serving platform like Double Click or Sizmek (Impressions, Clicks, Cost, etc.) broken out by date, site, tactic, creative, etc. Most of the ads that run are also tagged with Google Analytics parameters which let me pull on-site metrics for my clients like sessions, users, time on site, etc. The challange comes when ""merging"" these data sources together.I saw a video the other day - where I could turn both of my tabs of data into tables and then link those tables together using pivots. After, I could create 1-1 relationships with my dimensions but my excel program does not have the same options that the guy in the video had. To give an example of what he did was making the date column in tab 1 equal to date column in tab 2 that way I can have date as the dimension and pull metrics from both tabs for date.I understand that I need to create unique identifiers to link the dimensions I want across both tabs which I normally do anyways, it's just getting all the metrics to pull into one pivot table.Thanks for any help, I'm using Microsoft Excel for Mac Versions 16.22";False;Creating a pivot table with data from 2 different data sources (tabs);https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/b3dntc/creating_a_pivot_table_with_data_from_2_different/

In my excel file, I work with two sheets: Attendee Information and Sign In/Sign Out (for scanning barcodes).The first sheet is my Attendee information to be used as a reference for when we scan their barcode on the other sheet. I call this sheet ""Names and Numbers""; it has Individual's Barcode Number, First Name, Middle Initial, Last Name, Email, etc.Other than the barcode number, the attendee information is taken directly from an event report on ConstantContact. ConstantContact unfortunately creates two separate columns for 'Middle Initial' and two separate columns for 'Email' (one column for the main attendee and the other for their guests). In the past I would just copy over the information on the guest column of each into the main column counterpart. However, I wanted to streamline the process so that I don't have to do this each and every time.Thus, I figured making a formula on my Sign In/Sign Out sheet \[for the Middle Initial column (Column F) and Email Address column (Column H)\] that would look at the information in the main column, and if it was blank, look at the information in the guest column and if it wasn't blank, use the main column.

In my head, you would have a spreadsheet with employee salaries and a sheet with the market data.  Let's say employee X has 20 years of experience and makes $50,000 while the market has a low salary of $30,000, a 25th percentile of $40,000, a median of $50,000, a 75th percentile of $60,000 and a high salary of $70,000.  &#x200B;Typically we might expect someone with 0-5 years of experience to be between the lowest and the first quartile, someone with 5-15 years to be between the first quartile and the median, someone with 15-30 years to be between the median and the third quartile, and someone with 30+ years to be around the highest salary. &#x200B;I'd like to know if there was a way to plot this data in such a way that it would tell you where an adjustment would need to be made or plot the intersection of the data and the years of experience.  Again, I don't know if this is possible but if anyone has any ideas, I'm open to giving it a try.  &#x200B;Thank you in advance for your help!";False;Assistance using Excel to Plot Information for Compensation Research;https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/b2mka7/assistance_using_excel_to_plot_information_for/

Below is what the sheet is used for.1. on sheet 1 we paste the our current inventorycolumns A=item number: B=Location:C=Total availableColumns E:F we past the item number(E) and total needed to pick(F)2. We press shortcut key CTRL+W . This looks up our item number(E) and total need in sheet 1 and spits the looked up results in sheet 3 . It sorts everything by column A in Alphabetical order. Which is fine, but i need it to short it by the location (Column C1)it tells us where the product is available.Let me know if you have any questions. what it gives me :Item Description	Labels Qty	Location	Total available019-BLACK	        2	        31-07-A	              31		                        31-05-B	              5Computer Desk	        9	        31-06-A	              30GTX-1070-TI	        7	        35-04-B	              192GTX-1080-TI	        17	        35-04-a	              60		                        18-08-B	              500RTX-2080	        2	        Office	              80what i Need:GTX-1080-TI	17	18-08-B	500019-BLACK	2	31-05-B	5Computer Desk	9	31-06-A	30019-BLACK	2	31-07-A	31GTX-1080-TI	17	35-04-a	60GTX-1070-TI	7	35-04-B	192RTX-2080	2	Office	80here is the link to the code.

Might not be googling the question correctly but here's an example of my challengeI have a payroll report that has separate rows for each employee and each hour type (PTO, Regular, Overtime, Jury duty, etc.)Since there are multiple lines for each employee I have created a basic pivot table with filters to show only billable time (combines Regular and OT). Next I want to create an equation within the pivot table to show utilization % (defined as total billable hours divided by minimum billable hours per work (usually 40)). I created a column with the min-billable hours and added the equation but the report keeps using each line individually not the total my pivot created.

My goal was to write a user-defined function in VBA that allowed me to reference sheets by their CodeName.&#x200B;*(Disclaimer: this is more of an explanation of some cool VBA features than a practical guide.)*&#x200B;Every sheet in Excel has both a sheet name which we see in the workbook, and a CodeName which we can see in the Visual Basic Editor. Normally these are the same, but for the sake of clarity we can rename these. In [this screenshot](https://imgur.com/aKpBNRQ), you can see that I have changed the CodeName of Sheet1 to ""blue"" and Sheet2 to ""red"".&#x200B;Now there are two ways that I can refer to the first sheet of my workbook in VBA:    Worksheets(""Sheet1"")or simply    bluewill both refer to the first sheet in my workbook now. The obvious advantage of using the CodeName property is that it allows us to write a script that is not dependent on the name of the sheet we are working with.&#x200B;Unfortunately, it appears that we can not pass a string from a function to be used in reference with a CodeName. While I can take a string from a function and use:     Worksheets(string)it does not appear that there is an equivalent way to work with codenames.&#x200B;I came up with an interesting workaround. Create a module in our VBA project (which defaults to being named ""Module1""). Then add:&#x200B;    'These three lines will be rewritten    '    '        Function addCode(code As String)            Set VBProj = ActiveWorkbook.VBProject        Set VBComp = VBProj.VBComponents(""Module1"")        Set CodeMod = VBComp.CodeModule            With CodeMod            .DeleteLines StartLine:=1, Count:=3            .AddFromString (""Function getSheetname()"" & vbNewLine & ""getSheetname = "" & code & "".name"" & vbNewLine & ""End Function"")        End With                addCode = ""Code Added""        End Function&#x200B;Note: Before running this function you must go to File > Options > Trust Center >Trust Center Setting > Macro Settings and select ""Trust access to the VBA object model"". You should also change sheet calculation to manual (Alt + M + X + M)&#x200B;What this function does is take the user input and add a function to Module1 based on the user input. So if in my sheet I enter:    addCode(""blue"")The cell will change to ""Code Added"" (just a placeholder to show it ran) and my Module1 will be altered to:&#x200B;    Function getSheetname()    getSheetname = blue.Name    End Function        Function addCode(code As String)            Set VBProj = ActiveWorkbook.VBProject        Set VBComp = VBProj.VBComponents(""Module1"")        Set CodeMod = VBComp.CodeModule            With CodeMod            .DeleteLines StartLine:=1, Count:=3            .AddFromString (""Function getSheetname()"" & vbNewLine & ""getSheetname = "" & code & "".name"" & vbNewLine & ""End Function"")        End With                addCode = ""Code Added""            End Function&#x200B;You can see that the top three lines have been rewritten based upon what was entered in the addCode function. Now entering    =getSheetname()into a cell will return ""Sheet1"", the name of the sheet which has the CodeName ""blue"".&#x200B;Now if I enter a formula like    =INDIRECT(getSheetname()&""!A1"")this will return cell A1 of whichever sheet has the CodeName ""blue"" ***regardless of what that sheet is named***\*.\* Even if I delete the sheet and make a new one this will work, so long as I give it the CodeName ""blue"".&#x200B;We can furthermore write macros that allow the user to change the CodeName of a sheet without opening the VBA editor, or even specify what CodeName we want a sheet to have when we make a new sheet. All in all, probably not the most practical way to do this, but interesting nonetheless.

I simply do conditional formatting based off that row, and turn the font colour white. It creates the illusion that the table auto-generates. This makes me happy.I can do the exact same thing in this situation (have the font colour white / black based off criteria and make the columns ""appear"" and ""disappear""). HOWEVER, because it's a column heading it also needs to be formatted like a column heading. Bold / underline doesn't quite cut it, because it's many columns of data. If I wasn't creating an auto-expanding table, and I had a fixed number of columns (it's a pain when it's variable)... I would simply add a mixture of borders in different thicknesses and make it look nice and pretty, and presentable.If I pre-border X amount of columns as if there is always going to be data in them, then when there isn't data in them... I have loads of empty borders. This gets rid of my auto-expanding illusion.Hopefully you can picture my conundrum and have a solution that I can't think of.Ideally, I would like to avoid the use of macros. P.S.

My company sell b2b services either directly or via brokers - I currently work in the existing business team.My tool is essentially a series of (array) Index/Match options that his dumbed down lines of renewal notes into boxes requiring one of two letters of input. i.e. ""UK"" in a particular box will generate a line of ""Jurisdiction: UK (20% VAT)"" within the set of notes, then apply said VAT to a calculation of the premium for the year included further down. The finalised notes are pasted into CRM software and then I clear the input data out for the next contract. This is fine as it stands, but I've applied for a support role in the sales team. In that role I'd be tied to team members for a particular region and would be interacting with a smaller pool of brokers more frequently, gathering supplementary information (i.e. who our on site contacts are, any customer specific requirements, etc).What I am looking to do is replicate my current tool, tailor it to new business but then have my input data pulled from the notes tool into an archive sheet in a following tab on command.

It can be difficult identifying where the bottlenecks are, especially in large and complex spreadsheets.Therefore, I developed some VBA that I often use for benchmarking worksheet recalculation time. The code uses a Windows millisecond-precision timer to determine recalculation time.I adapt the code to the specific situation. For example, I did some experiments looking at recalculation time for a variety of formulae for the discussion [https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/b1ogx1/what\_do\_you\_use\_arrays\_for/#t1\_eioqya4](https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/b1ogx1/what_do_you_use_arrays_for/#t1_eioqya4)The VBA code used for those experiments is shown below. It shows the time to recalculate the workbook some number of iterations, to get a more accurate average time. It works best if you extract the formulae of interest into a new workbook, and then copy them many times, so that their performance can be assessed in isolation. Ensure that no other workbooks are open, as they might confound the time calculation.

Basically, if the criteria is met, E will be a positive number, using the same criteria, if it’s a positive, F will say “pass.” The real question: is it faster/better to have E reference A-D and output a number and F do the same, or should F reference E directly? Is there any difference between referencing another formula or static data directly.

Using a whole number between 1 and 2359 as conditions.Neither of these options make it so users cannot input a number like 0975.

Sorry if this is poorly explained. I am a first time poster and cant figure out what I am looking for to type it into google, hahaha. I am trying to create a material billing portion into an invoicing workbook that my work uses. Basically this workbook is already set up to automatically pull the labour charges on to an invoice by referencing the dates from where all the labour is summarized, to the date on the invoice.EG: If my invoice says March 15th 2019 the invoice will pull all of the lines from our ""Labour Summary"" tab that have the date March 15th, 2019 and enter them into a table on the invoice page.I want to do the same thing but for a list of material. I have figured out everything to pull the data I need, BUT I cant get it formatted how I want. For example say I have 6 material items for March 15th that I have entered into the ""Material Summary"" tab. When I change the date on my invoice tab to March 15th, those Material Items will populate into cells A1-A6 on my invoice tab. But now when I go to enter 3 material items for March 16th on my ""Material Summary"" tab, and change the date on my invoice tab, the 3 material items from March 16th are populating in Cells A7-A9. But I need them to continue populating in cells A1-A6! And I will be continually adding to my Material Summary as each day passes so I want to be able to click a button and have all the material for that day populate into the same cells!&#x200B;Sorry again if this is extremely confusing, I find excel problems hard to put into words, haha.&#x200B;Can anyone help me with this?";False;Help with auto populating cells based on the matching date;https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/b1n356/help_with_auto_populating_cells_based_on_the/

My excel skills are not the greatest thing in the world, but I can get around a bit. Part of my job is reporting financial statements to the members on a monthly basis. I use QuickBooks export reports as a start, but I have to show each restaurant side by side on the same spreadsheet. Some restaurants have different account names (made well before my time here unfortunately) so the rows never line up. I've gotten into the habit of formatting everything using ""=Sumifs"" to pull the information over in a more automated organized manner. I spent 10 hours yesterday creating a master template for all reports I need (Monthly, YTD, Quarterly, Budget to actual, prior to current) and I just want to be more efficient with my time going forward.&#x200B;The problem I have, is it takes me forever to change one cell's ""=sumifs"" formula from one worksheet to another. For example One cell on my monthly report looks like this (=SUMIFS('PreTotal M'!Q:Q,'PreTotal M'!J:J,'Company Monthly'!A152)) Where I have a PreTotal worksheet with each restaurant reported separately with their accounts out of line with the other restaurants.

I made a Userform for work based off some online templates. It's basically a userform where you enter information where you add data to a  very informal database (it's a blank spreadsheet tab).I now may have to make it more sophisticated, where my userform adds to a a ""log"" that's really a pre-exisiting report (let's refer to it as NewLog). Our company uses pre-existing Unique identifiers. In my VBA script, the two I am using are ""FallNumber"" and ""SpringNumber"". These are two separate programs. Currently in my blank form, these 2 programs share a row when I add to log. That's trickier with what I'm trying to do now. For NewLog, I downloaded one Fall report and one Spring report and smashed them together (not fancy but it works)  In my NewLog, the unique ID's have their own row. If someone knows how to fix my script, I can just split the NewLogs. My UserForm does have someone enter this Unique ID, so that's how I plan to do this ""Input with INDEX/MATCH"" task.If you were to just focus on Fall, I'd like when they click cmdAdd to add this data in columns S through AH, based on the specific row that shares a unique identifier of what was filled out.[Here is](https://imgur.com/I1wUPlI) the UserForm as a reference. Note Fall ContractID and Spring ContractID are on there. These are normally two separate spreadsheets, but NewLog has them both in a single Column, Column C. I'm open to 2 spreadsheets or something like that, however I would like to keep a single UserForm.&#x200B;Thank you! Let me know if you need more data. Alternatively, if someone knows how to make the SpringNumber a new row, that could work?

I guarantee there are plenty of other ways, i.e., way simpler ways, to accomplish what I wanted the spreadsheet to do, but this was how I did it.  Here is an explanation of what each sheet does:    Sheet Name|Explanation ---|---Master | The sheet will be the home of the master bracket, which I'll have to manually update, that all other brackets will be based off for assigning correct pick points.  The leaderboard will also be shown.  I plan to send this out to everyone before the tournament starts, after each round finishes and after the tournament ends.  You'll notice at the bottom of the spreadsheet that there's another bracket, but the winning team's name is replaced by their rank coming into the tournament.  This is for calculating and applying the upset multiplier.All Picks Wrong| I created this bracket to automate the scoring of the upset multiplier.  It looks at the match-ups from the master bracket and then picks the opposite team to move forward, hence the name, ""All Picks Wrong"".  I will most likely hide this sheet from co-workers view.Example Bracket | Self explanatoryBracket 1| This is a placeholder for each person's bracket.  This will be the formatting for the bracket that I'll send out to each particpant and then import into my master spreaadsheet.

Note, the multiplier only is applied if a higher seed beats a lower seed.  The upset seed difference multiplier is as follows:     | Upset Seed Difference Multiplier | x seed diff---|----------------|---Round of 64 | 2 | x seed diffRound of 32 | 3 | x seed diffRound of 16 | 5 | x seed diffRound of 8 | 8 | x seed diffRound of 4 | 10 | x seed diffNational Final | 15 | x seed diff    This will be the first year that I'll be running the tournament and that this spreadsheet will be employed.  I'm adding onto it every single day.  For instance, my cohort would like to implement a ""difficulty"" multiplier.  This would be awarded when you pick the winner between two close seeded teams.  The thought behind this is that it's more difficult to pick the winner between an 8 and a 9 than pick the winner between a 1 and 16.

A few years back I created a Excel tool for my coworkers at the company I work. I'd say I'm quite proficient in VBA/Excel but I can't seem to solve this issue.The workings of the sheet are as follows. An user types a serial number in a field, and the sheet then queries and gathers all product details and shows it back to the user. They use buttons to show/hide the information and start the search. These are ActiveX buttons. Everything was working without any issue for about two years and slight maintance kept everything running beautifully, with about 50-60 users checking serial numbers every day.Recently a strange issue started occurring. Sometimes (this happens to different users at different times) when they try to click the button, they can't click it and the button shows up on the screen again, a little bit higher and to the right than the original button. The second button dissapears when you release the mouse but the button is not 'clicked'. Nothing happens.[here](https://i.imgur.com/MHAsp1q.png) you can see it happening. In the first picture the user doesn't click. On click you the second picture. When the mouse button is released again it reverts back to the first picture.I hope I can fix this through excel, since I am highly doubtfull this is an explicit Excel issue but still I'd like to ask you all if you have seen this before and if you know of any solution.When users restart their computer it works again, sometimes.Much obliged, and thanks!;False;Excel form buttons on sheet not working for some users;https://www.reddit.com/r/excel/comments/b1f3dn/excel_form_buttons_on_sheet_not_working_for_some/

For example, I have this formula that I created for tracking average body fat:=(((86.01*log10(M2-L2)-70.041*log10($A$2)+36.76)/100)+((-98.42+(4.15*(N2))-(0.082*(E2)))/E2)+(G2))/3Just to go through it:A2 = Static height in inches (doesn’t change for obvious reasons. E2 = Weight in pounds. G2 = Body fat percentage as measured by my scale. L2 = Neck circumference in inches. M2 = Waist circumference in inches (narrow).N2 = Waist circumference in inches (navel). As you can probably see, the formula is split up into three separate equations that get averaged together at the end. However, I don’t want to simply average them at the end. I want to assign weighted values to each equation without using any extra cells. For example, G2 is its own equation that would receive a 60% weight. The (86.01*log10(M2-L2)-70.041*log10($A$2)+36.76)/100) equation would receive a 30% weight. Finally, the (-98.42+(4.15*(N2))-(0.082*(E2)))/E2) equation would receive a 10% weight. Obviously those weighting percentages are arbitrary for now as I haven’t decided on what weights to assign, but that’s the basic structure I’m looking for. I know I could probably easily do this with extra cells, but I’d rather not have to. Is this even possible to do and if it is, how would I go about doing this?Thanks in advance for your time!

That's what I call it anyway. There's probably a proper name for them.The concept is simple. First, you hit ALT, which causes little letters to pop up next to the tabs on the ribbon. Hit H, for example, for the Home tab, and a new set of letters pop up next to the items in the Home ribbon. Type N for number formatting, then SH for Short Date, and you just changed your selection to Short Date (mm/dd/yyyy) formatting. This works for literally anything that is clickable on the ribbon. Insert pivot table? ALT+J+V+Enter. Delete table rows (not worksheet rows)? ALT+H+D+L. Clear the ugly auto-table style? ALT+J+T+S+C. Clear all borders in the selection, then add top and left solid borders? ALT+H+B+N; ALT+H+B+O (top): ALT+H+B+L (left). You can type each letter consecutively rather than all at once like standard keyboard shortcuts.ALT+ functions are so much more intuitive to me because the letter usually corresponds with the first letter of the thing on the ribbon you want. J for Data tab is a little weird, but you don't have to worry about that because the letters pop up in the ribbon anytime you hit ALT. I honestly didn't think this was anything significant until I witnessed a seasoned co-worker simultaneously die inside and light up like a christmas tree while I navigated through his workbook without touching a mouse.
