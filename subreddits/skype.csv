Therefore, This fix is the only thing that will allow you to continue to use Skype Classic as much as you likeHowever, I found something that streamlines this method.Start skype in offline mode. Open process explorer and look at Skype's threads. Sort by Start Addresshttps://snag.gy/je7MSr.jpgFor me, the problem thread is the 6th entry for the thread. Sometimes the list will temporarily expand when a new process temporarily enters the list and disappears within seconds, do not regard that in your counting, we only care about the persistent threads.Once you find it, It will be the same thread everytime you open the program. If it's not the 6th thread in the list, you can sort by Cycles Used and use the method mentioned in the link thread to find which thread it is on your version of Skype, once you find it, switch back to Sort by Start Address and find which entry in the list it is. It is the 6th thread for me, take note of which it is for you. Once you know, it's memorized and this won't be a hassle anymore.So, See the '2' there? That's because I suspended it. Once it's suspended, open the settings for the thread and set the permissions like pictured. After that's done, unsuspend the thread, and activate your internet connection. Skype's logo will constantly spin as if it thinks its offline, but other than that, you will see all your contacts and can do everything just fine. Very rarely, Skype might kill itself and you will have to repeat this process, but I only ever see that after leaving the program on for days.Microsoft cannot easily fix this without a server-side fix that would have the side effect of blocking the update functionality itself, so I expect this method to continue to work for possibly years.;False;How to continue to use Skype Classic.

I wanted to post that I dropped Skype today. What started as a nice, lean application that did one thing and did it well (video and audio calls over the internet), the constant adding of unwanted features and bloat just got to me. I use this program to keep in touch with my family back home. All we need is an app that will allow us to have a video call. We don't want fucking emojis. We don't want cunting stickers. We just want to make calls. Microsoft has somehow managed to fuck this program so badly that the bloatiness of all these unwanted features prevent my video on my computer from being captured without dropping frames. I switched to Viber - none of this is an issue. Video is smooth, almost no frame drops. And it's not constantly asking me to update or connect to other accounts.

Here are the steps i did:1. Close all the system apps you've open in you device2. Open skype and log in. The upper message will show. Click download3. Play Store opens, ignore it and push the home button in your device. 4. Open again Skype. A different message will show up, this time skype classic will be usable after you tap ""Continue"".

To prepare for this, I bought a Logitech webcam (C615) and made sure that video and sound quality was good. I called my friend through Skype, did a test call, and even had a mock interview through Skype. It all seemed fine.But when I get to the Skype Business call, the audio went to shit (the interviewer could barely hear me). This was frustrating for me because I don't want it to reflect badly on me. I thought Skype was now set up for my webcam, but if the audio was bad it must have been using my laptop microphone, right? Wrong. I went to check the settings and apparently the Skype business was using microphone from my Logitech webcam. I'm at a lost here. Please help.

When I answer it, she can hear me speak, but I can't hear her.I've tried restarting my computer and she's tried restarting her's. We both tried seeing if any drivers needed updating -- They didn't. We checked to make sure all of our stuff was working. My speakers and mic are working fine, and her speakers and mic are also working fine. We checked skype to make sure it was detecting them, and it was. After giving up on trying to fix it, we decided to just try calling on Discord instead. The EXACT SAME PROBLEM happened on Discord. After Discord didn't work out, we tried calling on Facebook Messenger (the desktop version, not the phone version), and that worked perfectly fine!

My workplace uses Skype as our internal communication tool so I can't just migrate to Discord or another program. **I am using the most recent desktop version of Skype on my laptop running Windows 8.**With the new update, Skype desktop notifications now appear in the upper right corner of my screen, instead of the lower right. Previously, I had my notifications optimized on my work computer: Outlook email notifications would display on the upper right, and Skype notifications display on the lower right.

It works very well, but recently I was talking to another party with a brand new iPad, and I could not hear her. Video was great, and she could hear me. But her audio was pretty much non-existent, aside from the occasional fragment of garble. After trying all the usual things (permissions for Microphone, Internet quality, making sure my speakers were not muted, etc). I asked her if her iPad was in a case. It was, and REMOVING THE iPAD FROM THE CASE FIXED THE AUDIO.It was a hard case, ie. fairly solid plastic. My best guess is that her speaker output was reverberating within the case, and reaching the Microphone. Skype's automatic echo cancellation then basically killed every sound she made. She took off the case, and now Skype works perfectly as usual.Hope this is of use to somebody.;False;iPad Hard Case causes Skype Audio Problems;https://www.reddit.com/r/skype/comments/adeagv/ipad_hard_case_causes_skype_audio_problems/
