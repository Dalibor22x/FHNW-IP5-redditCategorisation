My current settings are basically match sequence and default amount of compression on the H.264 codec.Does Changing things like encoder profile, encoder tuning etc or adjusting the quality slider help in any regard?;False;[Help] Whats the best footage settings to have reduced lag in premiere timeline.;https://www.reddit.com/r/premiere/comments/b3ofzq/help_whats_the_best_footage_settings_to_have/

EAch cam folder usually has 2 files each (video recording broken up into separate sequential files).I'm going through each interview with the following workflow:1. Create a new project \[person name\]2. Ingest all three folders with ""use proxies""3. throw everything (in order) on the timeline and sync with PluralEyes to get the lav mic as master4.

Resetting the workspace doesn't work, 50% of the time the project panel just freezes. The workspace is broken and you have to do it all over again and save it... until you create a new project.What drives me crazy is that this major bug HAS BEEN KNOWN FOR MORE THAN A YEAR and they keep ignoring it in at least the two latest updates.

The camera footage was shot on the default video size FHD 1920x1080.The video is intended to be uploaded to YouTube, so I'm trying to optimise the video quality for that platform.Does anyone know what export settings I should use for footage from an S7 so that the Premiere settings match the camera I'm using?So far, I've watched about 5 different videos on export settings to use on Premiere Pro, but each one uses very different configurations, which is very confusing.I’m finding the main variations I’m seeing are in the video Bitrate settings. These seem to consist of some people using either VBR, 2 Pass or CBR for high quality. Would be good to know which one is best for using S7 camera footage?The other Bitrate settings that massively differ is the Target Bitrate and Maximum Bitrate used (when using VBR, 2 Pass, which seems to be more popular than CBR), where some people will have the Bitrate really high, at around 40kbps and other randomly low, around 15kbps.Basically, I want to use the best quality settings for my sequence, filmed from an S7 video camera, to be uploaded to YouTube and I don’t care abut trying to save file space by lowering settings.  I just want the most optimised exported video, despite how big the file will be.I did notice that using the YouTube 1080p High HD preset, lowers most of the export settings and makes the file much smaller.

In fact, programs like  PowerDirector can't handle what I do.The  machine I am using is a Cleveo laptop  It has a 4th Generation Intel®   Haswell Core, a i7-4790K500GB Samsung 850 EVO M.2 SSD, 32 GB RAM, and a   NVIDIA® GeForce™ GTX 980M (8.0GB) GDDR5.I  have to sync 20 minutes of high def stereo audio that was mixed from  multitrack recording software, to a camcorder video shot at 60 fps, of  20 or 30 minutes in length, and the synching has to actually work well.And  then I take the resulting HD video and cut that up to make an HD video  of about six minutes, with titles, transitions every minute or so, and  loads of subtitles. Typically this requires two to four tracks of video,  some other tracks for still photos, watermark titles in the corners  that fade in fade out independent of the other tracks, etc.When  I say HD I mean full 1080p, not SHD or 4D, or even 3D. But the programs  I have tried to use get choppy or freeze up during transitions, making  it very difficult to see what the video will look like unless I take the  time to render it over and over to check on the timing.Premiere  Pro may do way more than I need, but not much else will work for my  particular needs. But it is way more than I want to spend if I am paying  for many months where it sits unused.Thanks!;False;Can one subscribe ad hoc, a month here and a month there?

I don't think one can, certainly I couldn't get it to work, but interested to know if there is any means of inserting one or many spanned marker durations in to a timeline as whole pieces without the need to go and set an in and an out for each such spanned marker.My other question is, when going through a clip with lots of spanned markers, I find it easy to jump around between them using the go to next or previous marker keyboard shortcuts, but there doesn't seem to be any way that I know of to jump to the end point of a spanned marker.

I uploaded the videos as such to Adobe Premiere, with the frame rate being 29.97.When creating the sequence that I edited my videos in, I did not think to change the resolution to 1920x1080 as that was the default for Premiere 2018 for me. However, in 2019, the default was 720x480. So I did all my edits in there, exported, and noticed that it was blurry.I went back in to create a new sequence with the proper resolution and copying and pasting the edited clips. But, now the preview and export has a weird box in the center that's a slight orange color.

I was a heavy user of Vegas Pro but I thought it was time to make a switch. I was hoping to get some help with the warp stabilizer.Basically I have 4k footage that I want to stabilize in a 1080 timeline. So essentially I'm okay if the warp stabilizer crops the 4k footage since it will be resized to fit the frame for 1080.I was having some trouble doing this. Basically the 4k footage I would Nest and then stabilize. But it would create a black border around the cropped stabilized clip.

You'll want this so when you nest it, you can still tweak the timing by a few frames either way.**Does this mean cloning the track? What does it mean to give it handles? What do I do with the original clip?*** In the new sequence, change the settings to be the same res as your source footage (i.e. when we're shooting RED 6K HD, it's 5568 x 3132)**So if I am essentially down-scaling a 4k video to 1080, do I adjust the resolution for that footage first before warp stabilizing?**Apologies for the newbish questions... just trying to grasp my head around this.;False;[Help] Warp Stabalizer 4k footage in 1080p sequence?;https://www.reddit.com/r/premiere/comments/armd9s/help_warp_stabalizer_4k_footage_in_1080p_sequence/

1549662241.0;False;aolhe3;True;False;t3_aolhe3;10;False;/r/premiere/comments/aolhe3/other_my_frustrating_week_with_premiere/;5;Started writing down things that bugged me about premiere when I started work Monday morning up until now on Friday afternoon. I really wanted to see how often Premiere stuck out from other software I use daily (photoshop, AE, Illustrator, Audition, Office 365, Google docs, sheets) and it's pretty glaring. The only other piece of software I use as often that is even remotely close to as perplexing is Excel online and it is a distant second.This week is in no way unusual of my weekly experience with Premiere since things don't really seem to get fixed.First the straight up bugs, all of which have been there for me through 2017, 2018 and the new version 2019 and some even longer than that:* Changing to edit workspace (the default layout) sometimes crashes Premiere to desktop. This happens about half the time I choose it which is why, unless I am on autopilot, I never click on any of the workspaces anymore.* Opening lumetri scopes crashes Premiere to desktop... sometimes. * Closing Premiere sometimes crashes my video driver so display goes black. Nothing to do but to restart my computer and losing anything unsaved - in Premiere and anything else I was working on. This happens almost daily as I have to switch between 2018 and 2019 versions of Premiere for different clients. Before you ask, I use most current for my video card. Have all windows updates.* Oftentimes, after setting the audio output source in properties (for instance, after having plugged in headphones), premiere won't play back any audio until you solo an audio track and then unsolo it.... or you may have to restart Premiere.* Moving windows around within premiere is like russian roulette. Sometimes it'll crash Premiere to desktop. Other times it'll crash entire display, so any unsaved work in any open application is lost. (background renders, downloads, photoshop, etc etc etc)* Sometimes, when clicking on a clip name in project panel, the name goes blank so you can't see what new name is you are typing. time to restart Premiere yet again.* Want to include a mask on a layer in a graphics template? Sure you can do that, but it'll break animations on any layer using that mask, thus negating the purpose of making the template in the first place.Note: I realize a lot of these problems are most likely related to Premiere using the graphics card for a lot of it's work but so does Photoshop, Illustrator and, most especially, After Effects. I have zero problems of this type in any of those applications.Next up is basic issues of poor UI design. There is a concept known as user intent. It's the idea that the UI should make good guesses about what the user wants to do or expects to happen when they interact with a certain part of the UI. Premiere is very bad - and sometimes downright counterproductive - in it's assumptions about what a user wants to do in certain circumstances:* Whenever you make new sequence from items in another sequence, Premiere puts the new sequence in the root of your project. Same for nests. User's intent (at least my intent) is to keep things orgranized so I would expect that, like other programs, a new sequence derived from another sequence would be placed in the parent sequence's folder.* Nested sequences are named with zero reference to where the nested sequence was made. One would assume that a nested sequence name would contain a reference to it's parent sequence's name.* When maximizing a sequence to full screen, all tracks stay same height, even when near microscipic. As a user, I would assume when I maximize a window it's to see things bigger, both horizontally and vertically.* When multiple clips are selected in the timeline of a sequence, the volume level bar on each clip is still very easily clickable despite the fact that, when you've selected multiple clips, your intent is most likely not to change the volume on the single clip you are hovering over. Your intent is most likely to move or manipulate the clips as a group.* Clips that are narrow in the timeline almost always default to having their front or back handle selected so it's basically impossible to select the clip (the most common intent, for me, of clicking on a clip) unless you zoom in, scroll to it, select it, scroll out and then move it to where you need to. And lastly we have the just plain bad design choices that hamper productivity daily:* You can't right-click on an audio file in the timeline to create a new sequence from it, presumably because Premiere doesn't know what video setting should be for the clip. Solution: Let new sequence built from audio file inherit video settings from the audio file's parent sequence.* When importing illustrator vector file, no option to set resolution of flattened file during import. This is a feature that has been in Photoshop for years.* No equivalent to smart objects (objects that aren't affected by resizing). This has been in Photoshop and, I think, After Effects for years.* No browser-like back button in sequences panel. Want to go back to the 3rd from last sequence you viewed? Better hope you remember which one of the 20 you have opened that it was. or, Alternatively, close sequences in the order they get focus until you get to the one you are looking for. There in is the irony. Premiere keeps history of which tabs you looked at when but doesn't put that information to use for the user. Why?* Tracks in sequence window can get hidden because the vertical scroll/zoom bar can look as if it is set to show all tracks but it actually isn't. Solution: fix it.* Auto save activates the second Premiere is back in focus. If working on large projects this can be really annoying and be an automatic 1+ minute coffee break. Plus, what user in the world would want autosave to activate the millisecond they are ready to get back to work????* Autosave doesn't care what you are doing. It'll fire off in the middle of typing in a clip name, in the middle of adjusting a clip length. It literally doesn't care.* Massive amounts of wasted space above video tracks and below audio tracks is the normal behavior, unless you micro manage the track heights. By default, tracks should be set to at least fill available space.* Got a new set of graphics templates you want to import? Like 50 of them? Great! You can only import them one at a time.* Premiere never remembers which audio devices you regularly use. If audio device is changed, Premiere defaults to the first one alphabetically instead of looking at what device is currently being used and if it is one you have previously used and selecting that one. This goes back to how Premiere is blind to user intent. In fairness, Audition does this as well but it's equally frustrating.I realize and fully expect to have responses to this post pointing out workarounds or things that are super obvious to fix some of these issues but to that I say, firstly, thank you! Secondly, I say if I as a decades long user of the Adobe family of products as well as a host of other video, image and audio manipulation softwares, if I run into these glaring issues all the time, and there is a setting or a fix somewhere in the program, then it should NOT be hidden. It should be the default or super obvious. As an example, Photoshop recently changed how resizing using transform tool works and how ctrl-z/undo work to be in line with user intent and industry standards. Maybe it's time for Premiere to take a hard look at the decades long (in some instances) design choices in their software and say, it's time to rethink this.;False;[other] My frustrating week with Premiere;https://www.reddit.com/r/premiere/comments/aolhe3/other_my_frustrating_week_with_premiere/

Decided it will be easier to carry HDD and I will just transfer all data from GoPro to HDD somewhere somehow. Everything went smoothly until I came back home and noticed that 2 of 32gb folders are not on HDD anymore, even though I was sure that I copied them. I tried to use 5-6 different video recovery tools that took long nights to recover and I do not remember which one worked ALMOST - recovered some small videos (around 100) and 112 not. They were just big size files that I was unable to view. I gave up for another year, till this summer I decided to give this project another try and used Stellar Phoenix video recovery and tried to recover 112 files based on reference file (I got that from some videos that recovered) - and it worked! Recovery on reference recovers video taking information from another file, it helped as all videos were filmed with the same settings on GoPro. So now I have 112 recovered videos of which success rate is around 80% (some of the videos just have blinking pink background or some are 5 minutes duration but from 3-5 different clips) - material is good for video editing.&#x200B;**current situation (TL;DR)** \- videos after recovery are not suitable for premiere pro, probably because they are carrying information and are playable but not yet ready for editing.&#x200B;**Question** \- how to convert and fix all 112 videos to plain format (sound is not needed)? Is there a program which would allow me to do that and would take whats in video and just return plain error free MP4 suitable for editing?Here is one of the 112 videos which crashes Premiere Pro when importing: [https://we.tl/t-CqsrNsKu9K](https://we.tl/t-CqsrNsKu9K)Errors happening after importing: &#x200B;https://i.redd.it/f2d3fxlo17f21.png&#x200B;https://i.redd.it/a0ikce3p17f21.png&#x200B;https://i.redd.it/bkhg0txp17f21.png&#x200B;I am thinking something about simple stupid like just recording playing video to a new mp4 format to bypass all errors and export error free recorded screen - but is there any app that would do it?&#x200B;Thanks everyone who spent some time to help me on this project!";False;[HELP] After video recovery - videos are not editable and crashes Premiere Pro;https://www.reddit.com/r/premiere/comments/ao75ha/help_after_video_recovery_videos_are_not_editable/

But when I play it back (or export it for that matter), it's choppy as all hell! I tried leaving my sequence on 60fps then changing it to 30 when I export with AME, as well as making my sequence 30 and exporting at 30, and both look the same.&#x200B;I came to accept that this was because the sensor/original was created in 60fps, so bringing it down will naturally be less than what was captured, ergo the choppiness. But upon further research, I eventually tried exporting the original as 29.97 fps, and then importing it into Premiere. It looks smooth! :) So is the problem solved? Eh, not quite, because I'm still wondering why it doesn't preview right and work right when I just set my sequence to 29.97. Not only am I wondering but I'd like it to be that way. It's not too big of a deal because this one was less than a minute. BUT some videos I work with are 4 separate clips of twenty minutes each, so it's like 16GBs and 1hr20 of footage.

We typically edit with the WAV files (discarding the audio from the MTS files), then at the end of the project clean up the audio (noise reduction, compression, and Normalize to -8) and finally re-link with the updated WAV files.This time however, the audio playback with the relinked files is much quieter than it should be again around 8-12 decibels lower than what's playing back in audition. It's on every sequence in the project too, not just one or two. I've checked to see if the track volume was lowered, the clip volume was lowered, or if there were any random effects added and I can't find anything.Also, I drag the same clip from the project window onto the timeline, it plays back normally.I've cleared the cache and the .pek and .cfa files a bunch of times.I don't want to necessarily adjust the clip volume per each sequence in the off chance that something else happens during export.Any thoughts?;False;[HELP] Premiere Audio about 8 decibels lower than what Audition is displaying;https://www.reddit.com/r/premiere/comments/aj55vp/help_premiere_audio_about_8_decibels_lower_than/
