Other times, I have to wait 3-4 mins for the tabs to be updated on the history screen.Is there a way to just export all the tab urls to a text file, so I can put it on my computer and copy paste them?

Sorry for the lengthy title, as I am unable to properly describe the problem. I have been using chrome ever since I remember and never had an issue like this. I first thought that I am infected with malware, so I did a clean install and formatted everything, the issue still reappeared. I managed to track it down, and found out that it is not actually a problem of my PC but it is a chrome related problem.What basically happens is that when chrome is running, it tries to generate another instance of itself, and then shuts itself down. I would not mind this, had it not been minimizing my apps, and flickering my screen each time it happened. I switched to firefox and the issue does not persist.&#x200B;Things I have tried:\- Clean install, formated data.\- Deleted cache, browsing data, history, downloads, everything.\- Reset to default, removed all extentions.\- Cleared my sync data on the server and proceeded to delete everything from all my devices.&#x200B;The issue still persists.&#x200B;Here is a short gif showcasing the issue. Keep looking at the taskbar, you will notice the chrome icon appearing and disappearing for an instance.

Well now I have a special sort of question, this is why I reach out to you, hoping to find an answer:I have some sort of Virus on my system, can't tell where it's located, maybe its a browser extension. I first realized something was wrong, when my Google search results have been altered a few seconds after the page loaded, so I did the usual procedure, running ADW-Cleaner, full Virus scan (BitDefender, Avast, you name it), reset Chrome to default settings and reinstalled it several time, but I could not get rid of it. I've noticed a strange extension added, which has permission for everything (reading everything I do etc.) and I could not remove it, since it was installed via policies. It took me a while to find it and I removed it in the registry and change my Antivirus to Avast (since I tried a lot of others which just didn't fit my system). This was half a year ago. I uninstalled Avast like 2 day ago since it started giving more and more false-positives over the last months. Well just a few minutes ago, I realized that Extension was back. I just removed it ASAP. But I'm worried it will come back. This is where I come to my question.**Edit**: Forgot to mention it also disables Chrome Updates, returning Error Code:  3: [0x8007007B](https://support.google.com/installer/?product={8A69D345-D564-463c-AFF1-A69D9E530F96}&error=0x8007007B) \-- system level. Usually disappears after clean reinstall of chrome with the extension removed.Since \*something\* is able to install an Extension with full permissions, without Chrome notifying me about, which is a mayor flaw IMO, I'm wondering if there was a way to disable Chrome policies completely, since I do not use them. Basically prevent new ones from being created.I know I should probably find the root of the evil, but I just can't find it anywhere and resetting my PC is not possible at the moment.

My brother was playing on my PC, I watched him pretty much the whole time so I know he didn't download or install anything. When he left, I switched back to my profile to find a message by Ad Aware Web Companion saying ""thank you for installing"" or something like that. After using a combination of Malwarebytes, safe mode and just the regular old task manager I managed to erase every trace of it from my computer. However I am still wondering how this happened. According to windows the last program that was installed was the Chrome update.  The other possibility is a bit far fetched but also sounds like something that could be done. Besides me, my brother uses my computer from time to time. I never use an antivirus because of the resource hogging (specially during startup) and the fact that just having common sense is enough to not get infected. I explained this to him, but still behind my back installed uTorrent to download Halo 2. I ran some scans with windows defender and didn't find anything. Now, this would of course be the obvious answer, the thing is that it was around a year ago and he didn't download anything since. So it could have been a uTorrent update or some sort of ""dormant"" installer (I've no idea if that's a thing but it would make sense).And also, I know even getting media from reputable sources there's still a chance to get malware, but the last thing I installed was APE OUT from steam and that was over 24 hours ago.

Today I open YT- it shows me that I logged into account 1 and not 2. Google docs-same thing.For YT I only have to switch account to 2nd one time a day when I turn on pc, but for docs I have to switch every f*cking time. It's super uncomfortable.So the question - is there a way to bring this back to how it was?Or if there in none - is there a way to tranfer all my bookmarks/passwords/history from one google account to another? because it's impossible to transfer all my YT subscriptions/favorites etc.Thanks in advance.;False;I have a problem.;https://www.reddit.com/r/chrome/comments/atklbi/i_have_a_problem/

In both cases, the tab that you switch to has not been ""visited"" yet if that makes sense. That means that this new tab has been opened, but not switched to yet.
