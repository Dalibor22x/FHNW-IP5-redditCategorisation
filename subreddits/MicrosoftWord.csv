We're getting ready to publish and I've pretty much gotten the articles into their basic editing shape. However, one annoyance has cropped up for every article and that has to do with the placement of the endnotes section at the end of each paper.Basically, I want there to be about three lines of space after the last sentence of the main body. Then it should have the heading of ""Notes"", follow immediately by the endnotes. However, most often the endnotes list does not want to sit right under the heading. It automatically goes to the next page, leaving a large amount of space blank. To fix it, what I've had to do is either increase the amount of lines before the Notes heading, or I'll just increase the font size of one of the blank lines. When it gets to a certain point, the footnotes list will pop up right below the Notes heading like I want it to be, but it's finicky. For instance, increasing the line spacing to say, 12 pt might do the trick of getting the footnotes onto the correct page, but increasing it to 13 (or decreasing it to 11) will just make the footnotes go to the wrong page like before.Does anyone know what is going on? The only thing I can think is it has something to do with me deleting the endnote line separator and continuous separator in draft view, but I can't have these lines show up in the final product, so I'm at a loss. I'm prepared to swallow my annoyance since the articles look great otherwise, but I'd really like to get this figured out.

The underlying concept is that every object (something handwritten, something machine written) has an absolut position. This is annoying because in normal every day use one would write some notes with the computer and later add some things handwritten for which you always have to make space and reshift and so on (and making space in between isn't even possible on android version at the moment).In contrast word's underlying concept is that every object is enqued in a list. Thus when you add things on the top everything automatically shifts back. Another reason why this is much better is, that you don't have  a patchwork rug of text (like in oneNote). Instead you have a coherent text in a fine piece of software which many people use and have used anyway.**Background TL;DR:** *Word is imo much better for crossplattform (windows/android), crossinput (keyboard/stylus) note-taking than everything else.***Questions**:a) I only have Word 2016 accessible.

I have a Word document for a book I'm writing and I added custom fonts and changed Heading 1 and Heading 2 styles but when I open the same document on another computer with the same version of Word, the styles are all changed. I don't exactly understand templates etc. but is there some way to just share the same document with myself and with others and have all the settings I changed preserved (fonts, margins, styles, everything!)?

When I go to paste with something my clipboard, there are only four options: keep source formatting, merge formatting, picture, and text only. When I go to paste special, there are no other options and only checkboxes beside file types, for example, Microsoft Word Document Object or Formatted Text (RTF). I have attached a picture of this piece. What can I do to get paste special options such as formatting only? Note: I do have show paste options when content button when content is pasted selected. But after I try to go to paste special and check out the option in settings afterward, it is unchecked.
