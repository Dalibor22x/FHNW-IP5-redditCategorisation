No matter how good the internet becomes in the next five to 50 years, local hardware will likely always be a thing.The question is: how will Valve react to this? Back in 2013 Gabe already spoke about it and said he's not a fan.>Newell said that cloud gaming is great for caching and saving on network resources, but ignores the fundamentals of IP costs. ""There's always this 'let's ignore the fact that you have this network cost,'"" he said. ""Cloud gaming works until it becomes successful, at which point it falls over from its own success. As soon as everyone starts using a continuous network connection to get its applications, consumer IP pricing is going to go through the roof."">He also said that latency is a problem with the service in that it puts compensation for it at the center of the network instead of on the edge where he thinks it belongs. ""We believe that latency sensitivity is going to increase in the future,"" Newell said. ""The ability to do local high-speed processing will become more important than it is right now... We actually think there is going to be a bunch of hardware in the future where you have more sensitivity than a human does to latency and putting that functionality at the center of the network will actually be impossible."">In the end, Newell said he will continue to be skeptical of the whole process. ""If you really just want to have a standard client out there that's not a full-blown game engine, there are much better approaches than sending video.""https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=PeYxKIDGh8Ihttps://www.shacknews.com/article/77747/valve-ceo-cloud-gaming-best-for-demos-spectatingI don't think he's changed his mind that much since then, if at all. But I think Valve is still well prepared for the future, since they already offer Cloud Gaming with Steam Link Anywhere with the only major difference being the fact that you need to provide your own Cloud and cover your own costs.Valve has always been a proponent of choice. Want to play at your desk? Just use Steam as it is. Want to play from your couch? Use Big Picture. Want to use a controller? Pick whichever you want. Don't want to use Windows? Just use Linux or Mac. So what could they do? I think they will at some point offer the option to rent a Cloud computer for a daily or monthly fee. Licensing won't be an issue as players will just use their own library of games. The networking/streaming technology already exists. They also wouldn't have to buy licenses for Windows computers, because they already support Linux/Vulkan, just like Google. But that would just be an option for anybody who wants to use it.

MINUTES, You don't know how many times I have left my computer and went to grab a snack or a cup of coffee just to switch between a page, If I want to open my library I have to wait, If i want to open Unreal to work on a project I have to wait, If i want to browse the store for games, I have to wait for ages. Meanwhile on steam, switching between my library of games, tools and software literally only takes a millisecond to load.\-Steam is more lightweight than the Epic Launcher, I already said in the title that I am a LSG (LowSpecGamer) so I prefer not having any kind of heavy loads while playing in the background, the Epic Launcher is not even close to lightweight, the launcher will use 300MBs of ram and sometimes even 800MBs for no reason what so ever, meanwhile on steam it only uses between 50MBs to 80MBs of ram, not only that, Steam also doesn't use any of my CPU when i am not looking at it, however, the Epic launcher will continue to use the CPU (for some reason) and won't idle what so ever, this of course impacts performance while working and while playing video games, something I do not tolerate at all when using a launcher.&#x200B;Alright, we have talked about Usability, but what about downloading and buying games?# Steam vs Epic : The Library, store and your Internet.\-If you live in a country where your internet is bad, do not touch the Epic store, I have spent WEEKS to download Unreal, Fortnite and a few games that were free on the store back then, games that were the size of 10GBs that took a day or two to download on Steam take 4+ days to download on the Epic store, This is inexcusable for a company that wants to take over Steam's place, but honestly, if they can't make a functioning launcher why should i expect them to create a few usable EU servers near where I live, I guess all the servers are going into fortnite instead of their Launcher\-Steam also uses some magic tricks to make downloading games a lot shorter and faster, I am not sure how they do it but games that are 1GB in size can suddenly only need to download 700MBs only, Something that the Epic game store is not capable of. (If anyone knows how Steam does that please share it down, I wanna know what they do to shorten downloads)\-The Epic Store is Empty and doesn't have any good old games aside from super meat boy, Why would you stop using Steam to support a bunch of triple A companies and give them that ""extra"" money from revenue share? sure there are a couple indie games there but I seriously don't give a single crap about them anymore because of the Epic Launcher and how unusable it is, On steam I can get the entire Dreamcast collection in my library and I won't find it anywhere else, Just a few days ago I just bought Crazy Taxi and I started enjoying my childhood again in no time and I can look for older games on the steam store all day and buy them for cheap instead of spending hundreds of dollars on old (Rare) physical releases that might be a scam as well.\-Steam also offers great deals every week and the Steam summer and winter sale are my favorite times to pick up games off my very long wish list, something that Epic won't probably consider at all.\-And you know what else Epic won't consider? regional pricing, now...Although Steam doesn't support regional pricing in where I live *yet* they still give me the best options to save on money by not just waiting for a steam sale, they give me an option to go on other websites and get a key for a game that I want for dirt cheap (sometimes these games go for cents), Does Epic do this? No, sure they might do it a year later but it still won't be like how cheap Steam keys are.&#x200B;Now I have talked as a consumer, let me talk as a game developer now.# Steam vs Epic : Hurting developers\-The 88% revenue share argument is stupid, just because you gain more from every purchase doesn't mean that developers suddenly are swimming in money and that Epic is the *good guy* that is helping smol poor indie developers, If there is no consumer to buy your product then the 88% revenue share is just useless, Epic taking games and putting them exclusively on their store just hurts developers and makes the consumer either boycott your game until you release it on GOG or Steam a year later or simply pirate it.\-*B-B-But, Exodus sold better than Last night!* I don't think people account how Exodus had better marketing than Last night, I also don't think people know that Steam themselves promoted the entire Metro franchise before this entire exclusivity deal happened, I myself never heard of Metro at all until Steam recommended it to me and steam actually got my interest for Exodus, but what has Epic done? it made me just think negatively about the developers of Exodus and immediately made me loss all interest in the franchise and Exodus, and with that Exodus lost a potential fan and a consumer that will give the developers money to continue making more games, I was planning on buying 2033 on steam but now I just simply don't care about it and removed it from my wishlist.\-In short : if you are going to lock away your game behind a launcher that a lot of people don't like you will lose customers who will buy your game, this in return hurts developers and hopefully Epic doesn't continue locking games away inside their store only so more games can reach all audiences on more stores that are not just Steam or Epic.\-But wait, there's more : Since the Epic Launcher is big heavy load, indie developers who don't know how to optimize their games well (Or just uses the Unreal engine or similar heavy engines) will suffer heavy FPS drops on their games thanks to Epic eating away everyone's ram and CPU usage, thanks Epic! making indie developers look bad.&#x200B;This is my arguments why Steam is better than Epic, let's have a discussion about what I am right or wrong down below.&#x200B;EDIT 1 : I forgot to mention that Steam has a better API and SDK that is available for almost every engine, from Godot to Unity and from BYOND to GameMaker. EDIT 2 : Forgot to also mention that Steam has done more good for the Linux gaming community more than any other company in decades, Proton is free and open source and they also have listings for native Linux games which I don't think Epic has or supports.";False;Why Steam is better than Epic, From an Egyptian LSG/developer viewpoint.;https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/b464d8/why_steam_is_better_than_epic_from_an_egyptian/

Allowing developers to delete reviews and hide them is a really bad idea. If another customer was treated badly I would like  to know before i reach in my pockets to hand devs money.  Yesterday I got access to the alpha of ""League of Maidens"" i  had been signed up on their discord server for over a year, thought the game looked interesting.  I was contacted from the dev with a key and was looking forward to trying the game out.  I got into a game after playing with the settings, looking at the different shop items. I didn't really notice any mention of what the controls were for anything, maybe i hadn't been paying attention. I thought ill just ask on the discord as i had a marker telling me to go into the ground which was confusing.My question went something like ""I jumped off a platform on a bridge, how I get back up please?"" I didn't get a screenshot of this because I have been banned on Discord, Key Revoked from Steam and banned on their Steam Discussions.  I have what follows after that question. https://i.redd.it/tl151856gwn21.jpgI honestly didn't see any pop up of the controls, maybe i missed it but; regardless of weather it said on screen or not, this is a very unprofessional way to behave in my opinion.  One of the users on the discord server told me that the dev has done this before, banning someone over something small. I find its very petty way to behave in a business environment.  I was also banned on the Steam forums for this game   (League Of Maidens). I of course expected it after this but its worrying to see this being allowed.When this game is released on Steam and i make a review my review will be hidden or deleted.   I was in the alpha for Fortnite a few years ago and the developers would talk in game chat with the community, you could whisper them and get s response fast. They were very professional and kind. There was no tutorial or anything at the time.  Im making this post just to make people aware when doing business with these developers, I hope steam changes they're review and discussion system as I think it gives too much power to developers to hide negative commentary.

Trying to use the PS4 controller to type doesn't work because the left half of the on-screen keyboard doesn't register input, so that's two bugs before I've even had a chance to log in.Then when I do log in, sometimes I want to go check the store. If there's a themed sale, only the banner will load, leaving all of the actual lists of games blank. Going to a game's store page, frequently the videos won't load, and only slightly less frequently the sound on the video will be out of sync. Then when I select the info box, it only loads an empty black box where all the game's features should be. No video and no text description leaves me with only screenshots, so I don't buy much stuff in BPM unless I went to the store specifically for it. Trying to put a custom bundle in the cart only shows the custom price once you get all the way to checking out, with no indication that the price to be paid is different than the price listed.Okay, skip the store, maybe I want to go spectate a game. I really like spectating games on Steam and it used to work flawlessly, but recently about half of all the video streams have a weird audio corruption that's only present in Big Picture Mode. The same stream on the same PC will sound fine in desktop mode and then sound distorted and irritating in BPM. Long streams, like tournaments or marathon sessions, will have massive audio desync, sometimes upwards of ten seconds. The chat box doesn't scroll at all anymore, so whatever the first twelve comments or so are will be all I ever see. Any responses to comments I make outside of this go unread, and on a popular stream the comment box might be filled in seconds. If any of those comments had dumb or offensive comments, they're stuck there indefinitely.To add injury to insult, sometimes viewing video in either the Store or Community tabs instantly crashes the client entirely. Another trip up off the couch to grab the keyboard to restart Steam because the PS4 controller only controls the mouse cursor with Steam running...The BPM web browser is basically completely broken. It doesn't work well enough anymore to even bother using it. Like, the simulated mouse cursor won't respond, the controller navigation buttons won't respond, it assumes every controller has the Steam Controller grip paddles for changing tabs, bringing up the context menu is the only way to go back or forwards or reload or any of that stuff, it's an utter mess. And yet it launches that mess any time I try to go to the Steam forums for support or to read guides and so on.The library tab has the least wrong with it, but even there troubles are starting to mount. Launching a game doesn't always move the controller focus over to the game window, so I can't interact with the game and have to navigate the menus behind the game *by sound* to close it and try again. Other games won't launch at all, even Valve titles like Dota, because no matter how many times I hit ""Play Game"" and it makes the sound of the controller button being pressed, nothing happens. Sometimes after I exit a game it loads the wrong default controller scheme, or loads it wrong or something and the stick and d-pad will swap functionality until I power cycle the controller.Last and probably least, Steam Music scans a game's folder for audio files any time it updates the game files in the downloads tab, even though I have disabled the option to check the Steam game files for music. I'm apparently one of the few that actually likes Steam music for playing my own music over games, but even so it sucks having to constantly purge and refresh the music database just to get rid of garbage audio files it shouldn't even be scanning for.This list is incredibly long, and honestly I'm not even sure I remembered everything. I do the vast majority of my gaming on the couch these days, other than the occasional RTS or 4X game on my old bedroom PC, so I am constantly butting up against these issues. I'm not sure the refresh we're getting will address these problems, as the new UI looks 100% desktop-oriented, but I keep holding out hope because if not for Valve there wouldn't even *be* a couch-friendly Big Picture Mode in the first place. But my patience is definitely wearing thin.If you read this far, you have my gratitude. If not, you have my understanding.

The scale of Google is unimaginable. People who lived next to Onlive data centers loved it - we all live next to Google.Price is a joke. People throw money at games like its nothing. You will be sharing a high end PC on Google's servers with 10 other people. Google can purchase machines in incredible bulk like consoles and cool them at an industrial level.But having input lag is a compromised experience?

They will be playing games in 4k on smartphones better than anything they put up with today and it's seamless with youtube.You don't own games with Steam and you don't own games with Google. Google isn't going out of business anytime soon. They will make Steam seem as antique as driving to the store and spending an hour installing a 80 gig 4K game on 8 discs.I think most people just don't believe Google can do it. They don't think their internet speed is fast enough. We could just get a new wave on high speed internet elitists that treat Steam users like PC gamers look at console users.

I just seek assistance what should I do, and what should I do this to prevent him doing with other people.&#x200B;A person for months harrassed, stalked and cyberbullied me, just for self-entertainment. And because of this I'm having nervous stomach pains for days.&#x200B;Story shortly:After I met him in TF2, he quickly realised that I have a high level care about people on my friendslist and especially about people's personal problems and I make attempts of helping them as much as I can. After some time when he realised this, he started throwing hints that he is about to suicide. I personally take these very seriously, because it's not something that someone can just ignore and take lightly. One day when he knew I was at a dental clinic which he knew, he started throwing hints towards me, that he is about to suicide. I was from my phone  and I told him that I'll rush home immediately and I'll tak with he and will assist in every way I can and we did agree on we will talk about things before he is attempting to do anything. I rushed home, I did not even went to the pharmacy. When I got home for the entire day he ignored all my messages and he was just playing TeamFortress 2. Then a week later, he threatened me with suicide again, and did the same move.A few days later he started saying that he has major depression and alcohol problems and needs help. I spent days emotionally assisting him, even late nights after long days in the university. For a week he fed me with information that he become clean. Then one day he gave a hint of saying that he has drinks again. At that moment I realised that he was just messing with me for months. I spent around 2 months, emotionally supporting him, and as it turns out he is just trolling and harrassing people who care about other people's life.Yesteday I confronted him about this, and he stopped lying and started laughing at me.I don't seek any revenge, make no mistake. But I just want this not to happen with anyone on steam who attempts to help people in need. I spent months into helping someone who said is in desperate need, but in reality just 'played' with me. And right now, I'm looking at myself and thinking while being emotionally destroyed, why I deserve this. I have massive stomach pain nervousness because of this :(I know I was dumb, for believing someone. But I just wanted to help. And I also aware that there's a block option, I blocked him from my steam, and facebook/instagram (also he mocked me there). However I have no idea what action should I take or what shall I do, to preven this to happen to anyone.

For clarification, Valve is using the live version of Steam to test their new changes.  While they do test changes on their end first, those changes actually effect the **live version** of Steam.&#x200B;Last month, Steam broke admin functionality in steam groups when they quietly made changes on their end. Privilege changes to groups made by group admins were not effecting the live versions of said groups. When this issue was fixed, new ui elements were introduced into the live version of steam groups. Note that these changes did not require any client updates or updates in regard to Chromium. It felt like that in order to fix the admin bug, Valve had to push their current version of steam groups onto the public.&#x200B;Then, for 8 hours yesterday, all messaging functionality in steam groups was temporarily disabled due to ""Network Issues"". No other parts of the steam community were affected, and only groups were suffering any major issues. Valve was most likely testing if they could push an update and trying to find any issues.&#x200B;And now today, event posting in steam groups are broken. The given error displays ""**Invalid event type specified: (event type)Event**"". Messaging functionality in also down **again** due to ""Network Issues"", so it sounds like they're trying to push a major change into the live version again.&#x200B;Normally I'd write this off as Valve just trying to test changes in preparation for the ui update, but the timing of these outages is just too coincidental. A big hiccup the day before **and on the day** of their GDC conference is likely them trying to get the update working for the show.

Also, it will allow cutsom launchers like Playnite to integrate Steam much better, winning you bonus points in consumers minds.I wonder, if any Valve employees would be able to reply, I'd really love to know why steamcmd is so limited currently, and if my idea is something that is worth being implemented.";False;Dear Valve, about that new Steam UI.;https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/b42otw/dear_valve_about_that_new_steam_ui/

I truly realized this yesterday when I connected my Switch Pro Controller to my PC with Bluetooth so I could play some games. Not only does Steam have full support for the Switch controller and controllers other controllers from Sony and Microsoft, companies that it is not affiliated with and are even considered its rivals, but it also offers extensive customizability for those controllers. I can adjust the button layout to match the Switch buttons, and I can even change the brightness of the light on the controller. What’s even more amazing, simply booting up steam will allow me to use the controller to move my mouse, type on a keyboard, and create other custom functions that can give me full control of my PC without the need to get up from my bed and use my actual keyboard and mouse. No other launcher has this kind of hardware accessibility, customizability, and versatility (not to mention things like SteamVR!).

Of course this is partly because Epic is straight up bribing them with money, but I think the problem is deeper than that.Valve hasn't been showing much love and appreciation in the last few years.

It's a bad decision IMO, but whatever, you do what you do.   But the real issue comes when they advertise their products on launchers like Steam, GOG, and then out of nowhere, decide to postpone releases on those launchers by 1 year in favor of exclusivity with Epic games. I don't know if it's even legal to do this.  This kind of business practice really shouldn't become a new norm, because as a customer, this doesn't encourage me to switch to a new launcher, it just makes me not want to play that game on PC at all, I'd rather stick to consoles.  I could blame Epic how EGS for now is a untrustworthy launcher, with proof that it's spying on steam users, but honestly, Valve is at fault as well.  The excuse ""these things take time"" no longer works. They haven't done anything noteworthy since 2012, and it doesn't seem like they will. ""Artifact"" is a proof, that Valve might be out of touch with the community, when it comes to consumer demands, because only about 400 - 200 players are active. The Half Life 3 meme isn't funny anymore, when the company doesn't even acknowledge the franchises existence for over 12 years.  We can laugh how EGS lacks features, but this will be fixed in time, because Epic is very active on attracting more games and offering better revenue, plus encouraging them to use Unreal Engine 4. Valve announced Source 2 engine many years ago, showed nice screenshots of it and that's it. I haven't heard anything since.  Point is, if this goes on, the hatred for Epic will die down and some people will move on. I might try the store out if Epic buys it's shares back from Tencent (but that is a big ""IF""). But as of now, I blame Epic for snitching games like that, but I also blame Valve for letting this happen.

However, with all of the business deals that Epic Games is making with developers, and their roadmap for their store showing all of the features that they plan on adding in the near future, Epic Games plan of getting developers on their side is working, and if they continue to do this, they could take a ton of the PC gaming market from Valve. I think Valve need to put some plan in action to stay competitive, and finding a way to please small and large developers would be a good place to start. After all, without the developers, Steam would only consist of Valve games and be no different from any of the other publisher specific platforms on PC. I don't mean to take away from how important us customers are, because we are important. We're the ones who buy the games after all.

Been here with you guys from the start. With things recently, I begun to be more concerned than usual. &#x200B;1. Past Competition of Origin, Uplay, GOG were never a real threat to steam.They could only snatch up a couple of exclusive games, usually from their own studios because developers would not commit financial suicide by avoiding steam entirely when most of the market is there.&#x200B;2) A competitor like no otherEpic Store, from the backbones of Fornite, that generated billions for the company. Has a near-endless supply of money behind their backs. They can buy and buy and lockdown all sorts of big-titled games with that amount of money. Draining away the main titles away from steam slowly.&#x200B;Currently it is Timed Exclusives, a business decision as they know that alienating Steam will lead to loss revenue. Next time, they will be fully exclusive. Epic is growing and changing fast, they have a roadmap planned to fight steam with, tackling all the criticism the community has and is reacting very fast.&#x200B;3) Metro Exodus proved that the vocals of Steam are not that strongMetro Exodus sold quite well for a metro game, with more than 2.5 times that of Last Light. This was probably the BIGGEST TEST of water for Epic, they feared the backlash and 4A Games also wondered how bad it would be. Turns out....It was not that bad.&#x200B;WHICH IS WHAT CONCERNS ME.If the backlash for a huge IP like Metro, a PC-centric title, did close to negligible effects on sales, IT WOULD PUSH EPIC AND OTHER DEVELOPERS TO BE MORE BOLDER TO IGNORE COMMUNITY BACKLASH WHEN THE MONEY IS STILL BEING RAKED IN.&#x200B;Did you really think The Outer Worlds took that deal without seeing how Metro Exodus did? No sane businessman would have taken that deal if Metro Exodus crashed. But it did not, which pushed them over the edge to take that deal, KNOWING FULL WELL THAT THE COMMUNITY'S OPINIONS WILL NOT AFFECT SALES MUCH.&#x200B;Sorry for the caps, but seeing more and more exclusives get taken away simply to harm consumers is just infuriating, the consoles already deal with this, PC was mean't to be different. Is mean't to be different. We are suppose to be the free-land of the gaming world.&#x200B;My one true fear, is Epic, in a few months time, will be as feature-complete as steam. Steam, like all Monopolies and how they fell, fails to react fast enough, fails to innovate fast enough, where most of the PC players will be FORCED to go to the Epic Store as slowly titles are being drained away from Steam.&#x200B;His steps are as such:1. Make Epic Games Store Equal to Steam2. Tackle all Steam's cons from Steam Forums and fix them on Epic Store as improvements3. Ramp up Titles acquisition as fast as possible to snatch them from Steam4. Continue to release exclusive titles that were once on Steam to confirm Sales not affected by community backlash5. Once Community Backlash =/= Sales, make Titles SOLELY exclusive on Epic Store to steal more marketshare6. Rinse and repeat step 2 & 5 until Steam is dead.&#x200B;My Proposal to Valve (My opinions):&#x200B;1. Use your fundsYou have made more money than Epic has throughout Steam's entire life cycle. Period. Use your funds, GET BACK INTO GAME DEVELOPMENT. You may not need to be a game developer but, help FUND DEVELOPMENT FOR SOME STUDIOS. Keep some core studios at your disposal, so when Epic Store tries to snatch up every main game, you at least have a handful that will not leave your hand.&#x200B;2) SLASH YOUR COMMISSION FOR GAMES ( Price War )This is simple Economics/Business decision. If you are a Monopoly, and you have competitors attempting to enter the market. YOU SLASH PRICES TO FORCE THEM OUT. This is like how Wallmart or Giant or any supermarket store does things. Did you really think the sales was mean't to make consumers happy? Most of the time it's to force a competing Supermarket out.&#x200B;Steam, you HAVE THE FUNDS AND MONEY TO TANK IT OUT.&#x200B;3) Partnership with Microsoft or SonyI really hope that the partnership with Microsoft is real. Where all the games owned on an Xbox can be played on Steam, this sort of partnership is huge. If you are able to, get Sony on it (Unlikely). If you somehow can, get Nintendo as well (Equally unlikely)&#x200B;Developers are swarming to Epic because of #1, Money. If you can compete on the money front, your battle is nearly won.&#x200B;What scares me and what really SCARES ME, is Sweeney KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING.&#x200B;He knows how to come after Steam, he knows how to play the business and he knows how to win this battle with steam. Within afew years from now, I do not wish Steam to be a shell, or dead.&#x200B;Reading this post now, you may think I am a crazy dooms-day preacher. But this is my genuine fear, we have seen this happen before, from Blockbusters to Nokia, companies that sat on their market share with their heads in the sky thinking nothing will hurt them.&#x200B;Please Valve, we are behind you, the community is behind you, that is something that Epic does not have.WE WANT YOU TO SUCCEED.

To me there is only one thing I like about steam:* refundsAnd the only reason I like refunds is because of all the shitty unfinished indi garbage, I've never refunded a big title anyway because it's so easy to find out if they are good before buying that you don't really need a tryout.

Why does it take like a minute to launch a fucking browser! Also every steam game takes like 10 seconds longer to launch than if you just launch the executable, because of the little steam windows that says ""launching Warhammer II..."" why!?People complain when a game demands internet connection, but for some reason not when Steam demands it. Sure you can launch steam in offline mode but first you gotta wait like two minutes for it to try the connection and fails before you can do it, it's fucking bullshit. Especially when you are already logged into steam, you want to play a game but your internet is down and you can't fucking launch the game until you restart Steam in offline mode! Why can't I just switch without logging off! Why can it just launch the game without switching anything!?Cloud saves? it's again fucking garbage because it fails to sync so often and has to ask me which version I want, I don't fucking know I just wanna play my fucking game please!?Compare all this bloated ancient rotting garbage with [Battle.net](https://Battle.net), it's so much better, you just pick your fucking game, and  you play, what's so hard about that?

It's so easy!!User reviews? Ok it's not a bad thing to have user reviews but I rarely find it useful. If it's a big title like I said you can find out everything on Youtube. If it's a small game you can just buy it and play it, refund if it's a piece of shit. It's a place where angry mobs can review bomb stuff but why should I give a fuck?

I'll go straight with the link:[https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/steamulate/id1453118472?mt=8](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/steamulate/id1453118472?mt=8)&#x200B;Steamulate is the first Steam card farming tool/Steam account manager for iOS. It already has a lot of cool things, first let's take a look at its farming features. To make it easier for everyone to understand, I compare Steamulate with ASF here (which is a popular farming tool on PC).1. Steamulate has a friendly interface that you can do most with just a tap. On the other side, the command line interface of ASF might deter some people from using it.2. Like ASF, Steamulate has multiple account support, and you can easily manage them in groups.3. Intuitive card farming experience, you can see at a glance what games you are currently farming, how many cards are left, and how much time they will take. For ASF you will need to enter command in the console to see such results.4. In addition to the automatic farming mode like ASF, in Steamulate, it is easier to play specified games to increase recorded time. Also, in the wild mode, it drops cards in such a high speed that does not lose to Idle Master, and it is entirely possible to drop 30 cards in one minute. ASF does not provide similar function.5. In the automatic mode, you can drag the game that is being farmed to change the order of the farming. Steamulate will always respect this order until the queue is completed. ASF does not have a very good support for this.&#x200B;Steamulate is not just for farming cards. It also provides these features:1. 2FA authenticator. That's right, you can use it to generate a real-time mobile auth code, or to accept/cancel all pending 2FA confirmations at one single tap.2. The discovery queue can be automatically completed during sale events.3. Show custom online status to your friends, such as ""Farming..."". Of course, offline/invisible is an option too.4. Set an auto reply message. When any of your accounts receive messages from friends, they will be automatically replied and the message will be forwarded to you. Then you can reply directly to them in Steamulate.5. Easily transfer cards, gems, booster packs, etc, between accounts.6. Make/unpack booster packs, or craft badges, in large amounts. (Yes, theoretically you can craft 1000 badges at one time...) You can set up the list in advance, so it can automatically create booster packs for you every time you start the app. There will also be detailed statistics on the number of foil cards and normal cards obtained every time you unpack booster packs.7. One-stop service for redeeming keys/licenses. Enter the name of the game and check if you own it or not. Have you got a bunch of keys that are not well formatted? Just copy them and throw them in, Steamulate can help you extract valid keys, and then choose to activate to an account or multiple accounts. You can also easily activate multiple keys of the same game for multiple accounts.8. Do mass commenting. Want to post holiday greetings on all of your friends' profile pages? Just tap once.9. Get wallet balance, Steam level, amount of gems left in inventory, etc.10. Built-in browser with userscripts. The browser will automatically log in to your currently selected Steam account, and will switch accordingly when you switch accounts. Userscripts include SteamGifts one-click entry (a lightweight version of Extended SteamGifts), which should be very helpful to SG players.11. More! Please visit the website [https://steamulate.tk](https://steamulate.tk) .&#x200B;We will continue to add new things for Steamulate, including some killer features.1. Steam achievement management. That's right, you no longer need SAM.2. Community market transactions. Put items in the inventory up for sale whose price are below a certain threshold in one click? Level up to the specified level at the lowest cost with one click? Buy sets of cards and chase after high-value profile backgrounds with one click? (~~One-click to go bankrupt~~3. Background mode support, which will turn your device into a true server.&#x200B;Some statements:1. To use Steamulate, you will need to enter Steam account username, password and 2FA auth code. Steamulate is not based on cloud, everything is done locally so security can be guaranteed.2. The implementation is similar to ASF, which makes use of the open source project SteamKit to achieve access to the Steam network on iOS. Because the user base is very large, the risk involved can be minimized.3. Although the possibility is quite small, using Steamulate might bring unintended consequences. Please obey Steam's ToS to the maximum extent possible.4. About our Privacy Policy, see [https://steamulate.tk/privacy](https://steamulate.tk/privacy) .

Thank you all\~2. The version number increased from 1.0.2 to 1.0.22, during which I made a lot of improvements and added 4 new features.3. All testers used Steamulate for about 180 hours in total, and dropped about 210 cards (since the card statistics have a delay, slightly smaller than the real result).4. All testers made a total of 14 booster packs, opened 112 booster packs, and crafted 6 badges.5. ~~All testers enjoyed Steamulate.~~";False;Steamulate - The first Steam card farming tool & account manager for iOS;https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/b3ouvg/steamulate_the_first_steam_card_farming_tool/

EPIC the game publisher has launched the EPIC games store a digital store front for games.  Nothing wrong here and bringing more competition to the market will bring innovation and deals to the customers of these stores.&#x200B;In order to stand out from the crowd EPIC has been doing some marketing such as offering lower percentage of the cut they take from game developers/publishers which sometimes is returned by lower prices.  They have offered free games and good quality games at that.&#x200B;There store does lack features but there new and when Steam started up all those years ago with HL2 it did not have much of the features it has today.  We will see in time if the EPIC games store reaches the level stream is at right now.&#x200B;I have given EPIC a lot of slack as there new and competition is good for the market but that ends now.  There next practice is nothing but detrimental to the market, customers and game players.&#x200B;EPIC has been paying game developers or there publishers for a one year exclusive for sale of there games on the EPIC games store only.&#x200B;Why is this bad? Well if you don't use epic for a lot of reasons my own is security concerns then you miss out on playing these exclusives games for over a year.  If they are only on one store there is less of a change of lower prices over time and it damages the respect people have with the developers of these games as exclusives are exclusionary and those who are excluded feel resentment for those who did it to them.&#x200B;Yet still exclusives are legal.  You can pay someone to sell to you and only you but what you can not do is pay someone to sell to you and someone else and maybe another person but not those people over there such as your main competition in this case Steam.&#x200B;EPIC is going after Steam,  Steam has the majority share of the market and they are the ones who EPIC are comparing themselves to officially such as by the cut between there store and the game developers.  They are not using gog or origin as a comparison only Steam.&#x200B;Yet EPIC has done something which looks like they have broken the law.  EPIC and Steam are both US companies as such they fall under US law.  What EPIC has done is they have paid for a one year exclusive for the Outer Worlds game to be only purchasable through the EPIC games store AND the Windows Store also the Humble Bundle.   EPIC does not own the Windows Store Mircrosoft does and IGN owns Humble Bundle,  both of these companies are separate from EPIC.  I am sure you are not allowed to dictate who a supplier can sell to.  You can pay for them to sell to you and only you but you can not say sell this these people and not these other people in the market.&#x200B;Its market manipulation and may fall under certain anti trust laws.  Your supposed to conduct business by offering a better service or product or better marketing but your not supposed to inhibit a customers or supplies into not dealing with your competition.&#x200B;I am not from the US or a legal expect but even I can see what EPIC is doing is dodgy.  So is anyone here from the US and and in the legal field and can offer some insight if EPIC is braking the law by paying a supplier of what is going to be a large selling video game in the millions to supply this game to themselves and other unrelated digital store fronts but not other digital store fronts EPIC has targeted as there main competition i.e. steam?&#x200B;&#x200B;TL/DR EPIC has paid for the Outer Worlds video game to be available on there own digital store and also other digital stores the windows store and humble bundle which EPIC do not own but not the digital stores of there main competitor Steam and others such as gog and origin.  Is this market manipulation and breach of the US anti trust laws?&#x200B;&#x200B;";False;Is what EPIC Store doing with its exclusives legal?;https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/b3pn22/is_what_epic_store_doing_with_its_exclusives_legal/

This is not meant to be a rant more a discussion.**So today I logged into my Steam account to be greeted by a yellow Steam alert telling me that my account in the game ""Player Unknowns Battleground"" has been banned by the Developers.Obviously this was very confusing to me since I freshly bought this game and only have 7.1h of playtime and haven't touched it in weeks.So I looked at my Steam profile to check if there was the classical red ""game ban"" text.While doing so I noticed that this game was last started on the 16th of march.This was odd because on that day I was helping my brother and his girlfriend to move into their new apartment and the rest of the weekend I spent with my girlfriend.So I looked [at this fantastic help page](https://help.steampowered.com/en/accountdata/SteamLoginHistory) that Steam provides you, to check your recent login history.The first thing I noticed was a Chinese entry.&#x200B;[Recent Login History From Help Page](https://i.redd.it/onxehjgpiwm21.png)Obviously I wouldn't be writing this if this wasn't me.It even was on the same day where the game was last played according to my profile.And believe me when I say I haven't been to China yet! *( I wish I have )*Now this bothers me a lot.I have never entered my Steam credentials on any other site than the Steam Windows Client.Now the first thing that would come into my mind is that I might have some kind of malware on my PC.So I ran a full scan that showed no results.Plus even if it did I have protected my account with Two-Factor via Phone. (not the normal Steam Guard mail)I obviously immediately changed my email and password and in addition contacted the Steam support for further help and wrote:[My Message To Steam Support With Same Login History Screenshot](https://i.redd.it/dqy8ebdujwm21.png)and the replied blazing fast (to my surprise)&#x200B;[Their Reply Confirming My Account Was Compromised](https://i.redd.it/g3z2c963kwm21.png)Now while this is good news and they have given me instructions on how I can secure my account correctly, I still wonder how they even got access.My good guess is that someone made use of a [dictionary attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack) for my username and password.

Then we found out the Ubisoft extended their agreement with Epic which will probably wipe day one steam launches for ubisoft games for a while. Then we found out that former Playstation exclusives Detroit Become Human, Heavy Rain, and Beyond: Two Souls were coming to the Epic Store. Then they announced they are giving 100 million dollars to developers with their new ""MegaGrants."" There were &#x200B;I would say that 80 percent of the PC community hated this because they love Steam just like I do. But I do really think this competition will be a good thing for the industry. Steam has ran a monopoly on PC gaming for years. What was the last major competition they had? Nothing that was actually a threat. What new updates has Valve brought for Steam and their games? Nothing major. Now that Valve finally has a threat, there will be competition. Look at Sony vs Microsoft. For all these years, their competition has fueled them to get better. When one would mess up, the other would take advantage of that. Could you imagine how shitty things would be for consoles if there was just an xbox and no playstation? We would have probably just gotten the Xbox One two years ago. &#x200B;To summarize, Valve is going to have to wake up. They are going to need to make a response and win some companies over or more and more will leave. (To go back to The Outer Worlds case. They had to choose from 88 percent of sales with Epic or 65 percent of sales with Steam. On top of that I am sure that Epic gave them a bit of money on the side to give exclusivity with them). Whether its changing the compensation to match Epics or to actually overhaul the system in some way, they need to do something better. As much as the community hated the Metro Exodus move to epic, it still sold 2.5 times better then Last Lights launch on steam. The Division 2 sold really well on Epic considering the fact that they are extending their agreement with them. The Outer Worlds will still sell really good as long as its a good game.&#x200B;To end this I have just one request. If you are not going to buy the game, don't torrent it. Wait the year and then get it on Steam or buy it on your console. Maybe buy a key from a third party site.

Apologies in advance if the post seems long winded...&#x200B;&#x200B;Before I begin, I just wanted to state plainly that this post is mostly going to be heavily opinionated as well as having a few tidbits of other people's thoughts on it here and there in order to supplement my arguments on a few things, at any point no offense is meant or directed at anyone, especially whenever I happen to make a few quips here and there as the main point of this post is to spark debate (as civil as possible...) about the current state of things on the PC gaming end at least.&#x200B;&#x200B;With that out of the way, let's begin... and where better to start then with a simple question; What exactly has the Epic Store done to positively add to the PC gaming market as well as to compete with the PC Market Giant that is the Steam Store?...&#x200B;&#x200B;The Short answer is... Helping popularize the Battle Royale Genre in a seperate platform outside of PUBG on Steam with Fortnite... But outside of that, nothing that hasn't already been done by other publishers on both PC and Console, since it sure as hell isn't offering better features than Steam, yet...&#x200B;&#x200B;But what about any negatives that have come out of Epic Store competing with Steam and every other platform, surely Bigger competition to a big platform can only mean more good for us right?... I thought the same thing until I started seeing the immense amount of damage that began coming out of this, and it is only getting worse unless we as a community come together and do somethingabout it... as dramatic as it sounds, I'm dead serious here.&#x200B;&#x200B;The immense amount of damage that has stemmed from decisions coming from Epic and their Storefront has the potential to set back PC gaming years and YEARS, to the point where if nothing is done we may end up going back to the times where, Consoles and Piracy are the better choice again and the only reliable way to obtain any sort of information on games is through publisher/developer controlled journalism and reviews... again.&#x200B;&#x200B;All hyperboles aside, what do I mean by all of this... well unless you've been living under a rock or just stay away from the internet in general to avoid drama (which is understandable), allow me to fill you in... The Epic Game Store has decided that the best way to compete with a platform that has been around for nearly two decades is NOT to offer better deals, Features and Services to the consumer right off the bat, but to entice as many developers as possible into using their platform AND making it hard for consumers to voice their concerns... So in Short:&#x200B;&#x200B;\-Epic Currently offers an 88% cut to all Developers using their platform, and as a bonus, any game that uses their engine in their platform has the cost covered by said percent as well, a VERY good deal for UE Devs if you ask me!\-Epic Currently does not have any sort of User Review System in place, meaning if a game is bad, you won't know unless someone you trust buys, then reviews a game and gives their opinions on it, already a negative for the consumer... despite them saying not only will they eventually be available, but they will be opt in for developers (which already raises numerous red flags...)\-Instead of allowing the consumers to speak with their wallets on which platform they prefer, Epic decides that paying off Publishers/Developers for Timed exclusivity and forcing the consumer the choice of either using the Epic Store or waiting for the timed eclusivity deal to end shows just how much lack of confidence Epic has on their ability to properly compete... Yet another negative not just for Consumer Choice, but one that is also anti-competition...\-if that was not bad enough, they have also recently been caught taking data from Steam's OWN files without Valve's permission in order to suppsedly better serve us the consumer with better services and features in the future among other things (if and when they will get into legal trouble over this is beyond me...)&#x200B;&#x200B;All of this has pretty much culminated in not only popular and very anticipated games being held to ransom in a platform with an overall inferior experience for the end user, but has also led to Steam to also begin to buckle down, in worse ways than one, on several things as of late, that not only don't improve the experience on Steam as a platform at all, but also make it worse for the consumer all the while making it just a bit more favorable for big time publishers and shady developers... For the next bit I will be breaking down all the points In just made with their own header so you can just more conveniently skip to what topic you're interested in the most, as well as my Concluded thoughts at the end, I'll try to keep it as simple as I can... no promises tho...&#x200B;&#x200B;# Valve giving all Publishers/Devs an 88% Price cut won't solve anything...&#x200B;&#x200B;This may sound utterly ridiculous, especially since many of the big Youtubers I watch say that this is honestly the answer to ALL of Valve's problems and it would end up making the Epic Store pretty much drop into obscurity, but it seems that they really are not seeing the REAL underlying problem here, and allow me to point out to two things that supplement said statement:&#x200B;[https://www.pcgamer.com/steam-and-gog-take-30-revenue-cut-suggests-fez-creator-phil-fish/](https://www.pcgamer.com/steam-and-gog-take-30-revenue-cut-suggests-fez-creator-phil-fish/)[https://twinfinite.net/2018/12/discord-store-to-give-developers-90-percent-revenue-cut/](https://twinfinite.net/2018/12/discord-store-to-give-developers-90-percent-revenue-cut/)&#x200B;Let me ask a Question, if the Revenue Cut was the ONLY reason for Developers to switch over to the Epic Store, then why is it that the Discord AND Humble Bundle Stores have yet to become as big as Steam has? Why is it that storefronts that came out WAY before the Epic Store was even a thing, with a **MUCH BIGGER REVENUE SHARE** have yet to get any major publishers and devs to really look their way as much as they do Steam and now Epic Store... Something is not making sense here, right? Allow me to Elaborate in the most clear and concise way that I possibly can...&#x200B;&#x200B;**Valve DOES NOT pay Publishers OR Developers up front to put their games on Steam. Epic is Capitalizing** (pun intended) **on this and is not only paying Publishers/Developers for putting their games on the platform, they are also guaranteeing the game will make some kind of money by being in their store alone, even if it means Epic has to foot the bill**. In fact, they are doing so by making timed exclusivity deals, even at the expense of people who backed a project for specific platforms (my heart honestly goes to the people who backed this project, only to have the devs spit on your face by making it an Epic Store Exclusive for a year, even making it so you don't even get Codes for the Steam/GoG versions promised...):[https://www.pcgamer.com/xcom-like-phoenix-point-will-be-an-epic-store-exclusive-for-one-year/](https://www.pcgamer.com/xcom-like-phoenix-point-will-be-an-epic-store-exclusive-for-one-year/)&#x200B;&#x200B;Apparently, the amount of money that Epic offers Devs/Publishers to put the game on their Store front for just one year is such a large sum that the Developers of Phoenix Point even stated that even if they refunded 100% of all the money they got which need I remind you was around 1.2M, they'd still be in the green financially...&#x200B;&#x200B;So even IF Valve Suddenly offered all Publishers and Devs a bigger cut on the games they publish on the Steam Store, the fact that Valve does not give these entities more money automatically discourages them from choosing to publish on Steam over the Epic Game Store currently, regardless of how lackluster the features are on Epic Store or how many end users and notoriety Steam has, this is all completely irrelevant to a Profit Driven Publisher/Developer, especially when even IF a game does not sell well on Epic Store, they're STILL guaranteed Money...&#x200B;&#x200B;So does this mean I think Valve should also start securing timed exclusives on Steam by paying Developers/Publishers up front in order to compete with Epic Store? **HELL NO!**Third party, especially timed exclusivity is VERY much anti consumer/anti competitive as it forces you to either wait or use the platform where the exclusive title is being held at ransom... This is especially bad on a platform that limits end user feedback and their ability to even interact with said Developers/Publishers to let them know of their grievances with said game, speaking of which...&#x200B;# Giving Back Power to Corporate Controlled Reviews by Taking Away or Manipulating User Reviews...&#x200B;&#x200B;SO... Negative Review Bombs, they can certainly be problematic, but... are they really so problematic to warrant the extreme measures that not only Epic is taking with their Storefront, but now Valve is as well with Steam User Reviews? First off, to Quote the Youtuber Sid Alpha: ""Review Bombs are NOT a problem, they are a Simptom of a much larger problem... and that Problem lies on the shoulders of the Developers and Publishers""&#x200B;&#x200B;Let me use an analogy that, while it may sound silly, perfectly illustrates the point I am trying to make... Police officers... They exist pretty much to uphold the rules and make sure that said rules are not broken, they also exist to protect the people from crooks, criminals and anyone that may do you harm. So let me ask this question... Why is it that people have this almost unrealistic fear of Police Officers? is it because of the handful of crooked cops that happen to be racist or any other police stereotype you can think of, that everyone automatically assumes all of the Police are like this? If you are a law abiding citizen, then what the hell do you have to be afraid of?... The only people that SHOULD fear cops are the crooks, criminals and people that are highly likely to break the law... so then why? (and this is coming from a person of color, so if you attempt to counter this point with any dumb reason like ""I'm black and I've been mistreated by officers... do kindly leave now...)&#x200B;&#x200B;To an extent the same applies to Negative Reviews... If Developers/Publishers make an outstanding game with no issues and keep the nonsense out of said game, why should they fear getting review bombed? The answer is, because a lot of these Publishers/Developers are unfortunately crooks attemptimg to profit from us by any means, and they know that we won't let them get away with it without a fight, and one of the ONLY means of defending our right as consumers is via reviewing a game with our opninions on not just the game itself, but the devs/publishers actions.&#x200B;&#x200B;I cannot tell you how many times I had almost bought into a game only to read a few negative reviews of people that had played the game for countless hours, that complain about how the developer implemented something shady or turned the game P2W and the game is no longer fun which in turn saved both my time AND my money...&#x200B;&#x200B;Yeah, you can make the argument that they're far too easy to abuse by the bad apples that happen to Brigade together to review bomb a game for silly reasons such as Political Views and whatnot... But then (at the risk of sounding like a crazy skeptic) why don't we also hold mainstream reviewers and journalists to the same standard?&#x200B;&#x200B;For many years now, more often than not, these popular review sites which are obviously very bias and more often than not paid by Publishers for positive coverage, hell, they even get their copies early and for free just to generate hype for the game, no matter how mediocre it may be... Many of them have even been known to base their reviews on how politically correct or progressive a game may be, things which have also at times been the reason people have review bombed a game, and yet... why is it only user reviews that have to be curated?&#x200B;&#x200B;It's almost as if corporations miss the days in which games would sell no matter how bad they were because us Consumers had very little choice AND very little info to go by back in the days of game magazines and TV Commercials, and the only real way for you to know how bad a game is, was to either rent it from a video store, borrow it from a friend if they had it, or pray you didn't end up spending 40-60 bucks on a turd... Game Companies pretty much had very high control over what info we got to see and what was able to influence us into buying their stuff... and that pretty much began to change once user made video and written reviews began getting far FAR more popular than traditional mainstream reviews.&#x200B;&#x200B;This is honestly gonna sound insane but it is very much possible that the reason a lot of these Publishers and Developers are supporting storefronts that not only give them a big chunk of change upfront, but also keep any kind of user review at bay is because they want to be able to regain said control as well as make relevant the simbiotic relationship they have with mainstream reviewers and journalists again... It's possible that because they wish to continue to screw us over with half baked live services, overzealous microtransactions and Early Access Dribble, that they continue to resist stores that give the end user any way to formally criticize in unison any and all aspects that a game may have on release or even years after:&#x200B;[https://www.pcgamer.com/payday-2-gets-microtransactions-despite-devs-saying-it-wouldnt/](https://www.pcgamer.com/payday-2-gets-microtransactions-despite-devs-saying-it-wouldnt/)&#x200B;&#x200B;This might also be why Valve suddenly decided that the best way to bring said Publishers and Developers back is to... well, not outright censor what people have to say about any game published on steam, but rather maliciously manipulate user reviews in favor of Devs/Publishers by making it so that any negative review bomb time period not only gets marked, but if deemed by a Valve operative that said review bombs are ""off topic"", then they will be hidden and no longer have an impact on the game's overall rating on the Steam Storefront... There's only three eeny tiny things wrong with this issue:&#x200B;&#x200B;1. This feature may be optional, but it is opt out rather than opt in, meaning unless you manually disable it, you will be affected by it which is probably gonna be a lot of people...2. What is and isn't an off topic discussion when it comes to a video game review? is it right to let Valve or any company involved to make this decision on our behalf? It's far too much of a gray area IMO and is honestly incredibly prone to just as much if not MORE abuse by the devs/publishers in question than the review bombing itself...3. This can very well lead to a system that makes it easier for shovelware devs to manipulate their way into better visibility which may potentially make the Steam Experience even worse...&#x200B;&#x200B;Hopefully with the community backlash being large enough, Valve will realize how idiotic this new system truly is before the damage is done... now onto the next topic.&#x200B;&#x200B;# Bringing the Console War Mentality to PC Gaming, and then Amplifying it up to 11...&#x200B;&#x200B;We all know that exclusivity as well as Timed Exclusivity is pretty much a Console Market thing, where Publishers pretty much force an uneccesary choice on their players where if they wish to enjoy a specific game, they have no choice but to invest in their expensive hardware just to enjoy said game, as well as their yearly service if they wish to partake in it's multiplayer.&#x200B;&#x200B;With PC this has always been hard for Publishers and Developers to do because it is such an open platform that attempting this will more often than not result in very much underwhelming PR and a stigma that is not easily forgotten (just ask Microsoft how their GFWL and Windows 10 Store has gone over), hence why Epic is getting so much flak over their timed exclusivity deals. While you could argue that Platforms on PC, unlike Consoles, are Free to download and making an account with them really doesn't cost you anything but a bit of time, and that not wanting to download another storefront to your PC because you do not wish to deal with all of the clutter and startup slowing down is a stupid reason, blah blah, you get it... The problem is far bigger than something so petty tho... The problem is it can, and already IS setting a bad precedent for PC gaming which may very well worsen the experience of playing games on PC.&#x200B;&#x200B;For Example, Negative PR aside, if the decisions that Epic has made with their storefront turn out to be profitable, then it may very well embolden other platform holders to do the same. Imagine if suddenly, Ubisoft began securing 3rd party exclusives for Uplay for a year, and then suddenly... Electronic Arts with Origin, and then, Blizzard with [Battle.net](https://Battle.net), Discord, Humble Bundle, GoG, Amazon with their Twitch Launcher... now Steam finally caves and wants in and starts securing it's own 3rd party titles...&#x200B;&#x200B;All of a sudden you have **8 F\*in Platform holders** all competing for for your time and money, NOT with better Features, better prices or better services, but with the timed exclusives they managed to secure... Not only would this utterly destroy the open nature and choice friendly platform that is the PC, but it would not benefit us the end user in any way and would instead inconvenience us to such a point that we would not only be better off going back to Console or Mobile gaming as the most mainstream way to game, but even Piracy, which according to Lord Gabe Newell himself, Steam was made to be a better service than Piracy ever could be, would be a better service than ALL 8 of said platforms combined...&#x200B;&#x200B;# In Conclusion:&#x200B;If this is a future you DO NOT WANT for PC gaming, then we HAVE to start fighting this now, or else it may very well happen... last time I checked, no amount of bad PR unless it's bad enough to affect the bottom line of these companies, will make them stop pursuing anti consumer and anti competitive practices...&#x200B;&#x200B;I don't hate gaming on Console OR Mobile by the way (believe you me, I did both exclusively for a long LONG time...), I just prefer gaming on PC now due to how convenient, versatile, cheap and easy to upgrade it is... that unfortunately is now being threatened by Developers, Publishers and a Platformholder that would sooner see ALL the hardwork and dedication the PC gaming community put into making this an amazing platform to play on all in the name of short term, profit driven thinking, than to properly compete and strenghten an already amazing platform by offering True, Healthy competition that Valve really has needed for awhile now...&#x200B;&#x200B;Feel Free to contribute to this post in any way that you'd like... if possible share it so that others can see and keep the discussion going. The longer we keep bring it up, the sooner someone that CAN make a difference will notice and start promoting change for the better... DO NOT let PC gaming fall and turn into a closed platform that only benefits the Publishers, Developers and Shill Media involved.&#x200B;Peace out guys! :3";False;The Consequences of Popular but Very Bad Competition...;https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/b2qv1c/the_consequences_of_popular_but_very_bad/

If you have bought any additional content in any games then I would appreciate if you could fill out [this survey.](https://survey.napier.ac.uk/n/zz4tq.aspx)As for what the survey is about, the aim of it is to allow players to show their attitudes towards specific types of additional content in games that they have purchased - these include the regular types such as DLC, micro-transactions, expansions (or expansion packs), and loot boxes. It is also intended to show which factors are most important to players when buying (or considering buying) any of these types of content, such as quality or quantity. With a good-enough sample size, this should hopefully lead to some interesting insight.Again, all responses are appreciated and you are free to drop the survey at any time. Thanks.As a point of discussion to flesh this post out a bit, I would like to know what your opinions are on the ability to buy in-game currency in a game with real money, specifically games that you have to pay upfront for (such as $60 games). An example of this would be the recent Devil May Cry 5, a game that I have been playing for the last week or so and loving it so far. One thing that stood out to me though is that you can purchase the in-game currency (red orbs) with real money, which would then allow you to buy upgrades, new abilities, new moves, some consumables, as well as some character-exclusive taunts that cost a *lot* of red orbs.Do you believe that this is greedy or just needless to include? Would this, to any extent, affect your willingness to buy a game if you knew that it allowed you to purchase its in-game currency?

I'm using the beta version of steam. I have terrible internet DL speeds and don't want to revert if I don't need to.Anyways, I can't connect to voice chat. Sometimes it will work (like last night) after numerous reconnection attempts. My friend isn't even being notified that I'm calling him, but his calls come through to me. When I click ""Start Voice Chat"" (accepting his call), it shows ""Connecting..."" on the top of my friends list and then it will time out. I would say my success rate is probably in the 5% range.I've tried forwarding all steam ports, but to no avail. Granted, I'm on a dynamic IP that is unchangeable due to my ISP, and I'm not sure if that's the problem. I'm not the most tech savvy, but I'm 99% sure my ports are forwarded correctly.Discord works fine, and in-game voice chat also works fine. Anyone have any ideas?  EDIT: I believe my friend is using the stable branch of Steam and not the beta. Is this a potential issue?

The points are ranked and described. Don't forget, these are personal reason, so they may not apply to you. I made this list, so I can link to it in other threads as a comprehensive description.&#x200B;**1. Most Important:*** *Linux support and Steam Play*: I use a Linux based machine as my main system and Windows for gaming. I would like to get rid of Windows or minimize the usage of it some day. Steam supports native Linux builds/ports. It even goes a step further, where Windows based games can be played on Linux with a special translation software, without or with little performance hit. It is still in early phase and does not work perfectly, but for the future it will be one of my main points.* *User Reviews*: I don't accept a market place where users don't have a voice. I lookup the ratings, read some user reviews and write my own from time to time. One of the most basic requirements to me.* *Split user base and friend lists*: Not a feature, but a big deal to me. I don't want use and organize two separate programs and friend lists. Games aren't compatible between clients (unless they are). If I want play a game with friends, then we need to make sure that we have the same game on the same market place and all friends have to download and install the other client, we have to add and organize, buy the game again. Redundant work.* *Trust*: The Epic store seems to spy the Steam users, which classifies it as a spyware. It is owned by Tencent, a Chinese company known for selling user data without asking its users. I don't trust them. There is nothing similar known to Steam.**2. Very Important:*** *Achievements*: I like to collect Achievements and showcase them on my profile. It adds another layer of fun and challenges.* *Library sorting*: An obvious basic feature. I have a lot of games and want be able to sort them after different criteria.* *Refund done easy*: Valve makes it very easy to refund a game. You just click through a simple process and get your refund fast and easy, if you didn't play the game for long time. This is much more complicated and restricted in the Epic store.* *Gamepad extended support*: Steam supports a lot of variety of gamepads, custom button mappings and has unique features. Even games without gamepad support can be configured to play with. Users can upload and download profiles from other users.* *Great Sales*: Who don't like sales and events? ;-) Valve offers the best sales experiences in the world!* *VAC and free Server protection*: VAC is a good way to ban cheaters. Currently only Valve games support this, but it will be open to other developers soon. Also Valve offers free server protection to any developer for free (recently added).**3. Half Important:*** *Streaming Gaming*: Started as In-Home Streaming, now supports streaming your pc games over the internet for free. While I don't need or use this, I can only imagine the usefulness in the future for some titles.* *Family Sharing*: I have ton of quality games and I share them with my brother. He definitely would miss that option. ;-)* *Forums and Groups*: Each game and other categories have its own dedicated sub forum like in Reddit. You don't need to search the web for an official or unofficial forum, it is just integrated. Also there are social places to share videos, screenshots, workshops, guides and such and users can create groups.* *Statistics*: Generally speaking I like the open nature of Steam, presenting statistics of player counts and hardware survey.* *Mod / Workshop*: I appreciate the integrated function for mods and love the creativity of the fans. This makes the user experience much more secure too, so people don't try out random installers from the web.* *Screenshot Capture and Share*: I take a lot of screenshots while gaming, sometimes I start a game only to take pictures and edit them. There are alternatives, but its neat to have this integrated into Steam, which works flawlessly and even it supports uploading and presenting on profile.* *Wish Lists*: No need to organize a separate notes of which games I wish. It can be sorted after different criteria, like price or game title and will notify if anything on the list get discount.**4. Less Important:*** *Broadcasting Watch*: Like Twitch, but Steam only I guess. Just used it once to test it out. At least the user don't need to use third party application and don't need to configure and understand complex mechanism to stream to Twitch. Steam friends can just watch me, if I allow.* *Gifts*: Sometimes handy, but nothing I really need desperately. Tough my brother and me used this function twice or three times.* *User Profiles*: Profiles gives users some sort of personality. If it is not hidden, I can visit to look what he played recently, what he likes and more.* *Curators*: A user or group to follow to get recommendations about games. I don't use or visit this functionality at the moment, but I like the idea of it.* *Quite open to almost all kind of games*: Off course there are some grey areas and when Valve removes games like raping a woman and such, but I can understand that. The line is thin, but there is one. Still Steam is flooded with low effort products and this is a definitive minus. But for the most part, anyone can do sell games and you can go and show boobs if you want. The relative open nature (relative to all other platforms) is a curse and a win at the same time.**5. No opinion, but some others might find this important:*** *Item Trading*: I don't trade items with others, so not important to me.* *Regional Pricing*: I don't know how I feel about this.**0. Key Features, which are added in Epic Launcher at later time, so they don't count anymore.*** *Cloud Saves*: Its a good backup and I never want a launcher without Cloud Saves anymore. I already lost save files in the past.* *Offline Play*: This was also important to me, as I occasionally had no internet for days.";False;My personal list why I stay in Steam and don't want to use Epic Launcher;https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/b17q3e/my_personal_list_why_i_stay_in_steam_and_dont/

I purchased it back in early Feb when it was on sale and just recently tried to download it. It downloaded like 11 gigs (out of 56) and then the next time I started Steam up, it reset to 0 bytes downloaded. I was very pissed. I contacted Steam support and they gave me some canned response basically saying ""we can't do anything, it sometimes happens when Steam updates or you shutdown your pc....blah blah"". And yet in all my 13 years on Steam, this has never happened before. I've updated Steam, shutdown my pc, closed steam and all that the support person told me causes this problem and always was able to resume my game downloads with no problems. I responded to the support person's comment by noting this fact and also that free download managers can download files without losing their progress even if you shut them down or turn off your pc.&#x200B;So part II: I restarted the downloading process. Because I live in a house with other people who want to use the internet too, I have limited my downloading to late at night when everyone is asleep. And at the rate of around \~10gigs per night, I knew the entire process would around 4 or 5 days (with some downloading during the daytime as well). I got all the way to 46 gigs after about 4 days (by Thursday morning). I left my PC and Steam on for those 4 days to avoid the possible causes that the support person listed for the problem. Last night when I went to sleep it said the download would be done in 4 hours. I knew when I woke up it would be done. Wrong. When I wake up, the game has been requeued with 0 bytes progress. I'm beyond pissed at Steam right now. I just put in a refund request for the game. I had purchased another large game (GTA V) because it was recently on sale, and now I'm assuming I will have the same problem downloading that game so what's the point? I am thinking of refunding that game as well. I also don't see the point in purchasing games from Steam at all anymore. What is the point if they are going to finish downloading and then reset to 0 bytes downloaded and requeue??? I'm just wondering if this is a known issue with that one game in particular (TCRSS) or has this glitch recently been introduced and happening with all games right now? What the f#$## can I do other than stop using Steam permanently?

Many of you are by now aware that Randy Pitchford made some comments on Twitter, dating as far back as late 2018 that indicate support for the Epic Games Store and their tactic of paying for third-party exclusives.Another thing, that everyone else seems to have missed is that Sergey Galyonkin, Director of Publishing Strategy at Epic Games retweeted the tease which lead to the Borderlands 3 announcement rumours. This is a guy who with very few exceptions retweets game-related news only when they are connected with Epic Games in some way.Anyway, lets go back to Randy Pitchford and his comments which indicate that Borderlands 3 is likely to be an Epic Games Store exclusive. Interestingly, his comments are in contrast with the current stance of Take-Two Inteactive. During their earnings call in February, the CEO, Strauss Zelnick was asked on his opinion of Epic Games and exclusivity when it comes to selling games in general. The summary of his response is that Take-Two welcomes competition in online game distribution for PC, but they do not believe in making their games exclusive to a specific platform and would much rather distribute them to every storefront. For those who don't know, Take-Two is the parent company of 2k games, the company which publishes the Borderlands franchise. Game publishers are generally the ones who decide where a game is distributed.Here's why all of this seems so fishy to me. People generally believe that since Pitchford posted the comment supporting the Epic Games Store, an exclusivity deal has already been struck, yet more than a month later the CEO of Take-Two, whose word carries far more weight basically said the exact opposite.I am getting into conspiracy theory territory here, but what I think might be happening is that Randy Pitchord knew that his comments hinting at exclusivity would stir up controversy, and he wants to use that controversy as free publicity which would make them look even better once they announce Borderlands 3 as a non-exclusive game. I should note, that even if it releases on Steam, it is all but confirmed that Borderlands 3 will ship to the Epic Store.Sources:https://za.ign.com/strauss-zelnick/129331/news/take-two-ceo-on-epic-store-we-have-not-been-a-believer-in-exhttps://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1070125621785714688https://twitter.com/galyonkin?lang=en;False;My take on the Borderlands 3 Epic Exclusivity rumours.;https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/b15p46/my_take_on_the_borderlands_3_epic_exclusivity/

Lets get to it. ***Steam: Improvements for a future release***This thread's main goal is to point out the current issues I have been having with Steam and how to improve them in a future release, according to a laptop gamer’s point of view.To start lets address the #1 source of headache for Laptop Gamers:\[dGPU vs. iGPU\]→ Issue #1: After Steam has been installed by the user and opened up, *by default Steam will be launched detecting the iGPU, meaning that’s the only GPU it sees in the system and therefore, Steam games will be rendered using iGPU instead of the dGPU, which is beefier and more capable of delivering a much better rendering.*→ **Proposed Resolution to fix this problem:**&#x200B;[The new Interface settings: let Steam know about and handle iGPU and dGPU.](https://i.redd.it/ffnn5yjc8yl21.png)&#x200B;Under Interface Settings, Steam can allow the user to toggle “Laptop Mode” ON by checking the box next to it. Once enabled, Steam will be able to detect another video card in the system by performing this command in the background:>xrandr –listproviders Which will reveal the other GPU (dedicated GPU or dGPU); Once detected, Steam would popup a message saying:  > Found the following GPUs in this system:  >  >GPU0: <<result of GPU0 from the command>>  >  >GPU1: <<result of GPU1 from the command>>Mine returns:&#x200B;[xrandr can give a direct result to Steam about different graphics card on the system.](https://i.redd.it/u2o5bpjy8yl21.png) Laptop Mode will then use that data to populate its option list, which will be provided for the user to pick a GPU to start a game with, as demonstrated in this figure down below:&#x200B;[The new Steam with Laptop Mode enabled: allowing users to choose which GPU they'd like to launch a game with.](https://i.redd.it/erwm38km9yl21.png)&#x200B;When the user decides to use the integrated GPU (or iGPU), Steam will launch the game with no tweaks nor any launch options.However, if the user wants to go with the dGPU instead, Steam will add ‘DRI\_PRIME=1 %command%’ in order to let the dedicated GPU handle the rendering.I know this might seem to be too much *just to add one launch option*, but the reality is most laptop gamers who come from Windows don’t want to deal with any of that, so making these options a click away from the user adds a lot, in terms of convenience.&#x200B;""That's cool. But what if the game I want to play isn't compatible with Linux?"" - That's where issue #2 kicks in. → Issue #2: When the user is on the Steam Store looking for a game to buy and is interested in a windows-only racing game, there is no extra data, from the store, letting them know how great the game runs via SteamPlay.**Proposed resolution to fix this problem:** ***WHEN THE CLIENT DETECTS the user is running a LINUX DISTRO,*** integrate the data from Protondb.com and display its score along with supported platforms, so that the user can make up their mind before proceeding to checkout. Every single game on the store has a dedicated metacritic review score on the right side of the store layout – Do the same and integrate the data from ProtonDB into the page for Linux users who’d like to try out a Windows-only game, like the picture below shows:&#x200B;[Integrated ProtonDB Compatibility Score sticker: letting users know, from the store, how great the game MAY run on their system.](https://i.redd.it/vg1kaj1eayl21.png) I know that sticker looks way too invasive where it is, but if there was a Linux/SteamOS tab under System Requirements, it’d be the proper location to place it. But you get the idea.With that ProtonDB compatibility score sticker, the user can make up their mind on whether to buy it or not before even leaving the store. Now, obviously that sticker gives a GENERAL idea on compatibility, so the user might click on it in order to investigate further which graphics card (AMD/Nvidia) that feedback was based on. It’s just more convenient this way.&#x200B;Those are my suggestions for a much better and more convenient Steam Client on Linux, especially for the users who are sick of Windows and want to experience Steam on Linux without having to rely on coding or launch attributes that often. Feel free to add more to the conversation. Keep it civil please.";False;[Ideas and Suggestions] What's next for the Steam Client on Linux?

However, there is an internet cafe nearby which has a fast connection(2mb/s) on steam, yet has been protected by deepfreeze so anytime you’re done with your pc it will wipe everything back again.I couldn’t imagine myself there sitting waiting for 4-5 hours for gta to download completely, and probably another couple of hours waiting to write it on my external hd (at least in one setting). So my plan is to:- spend there for about an hour a day , download gta- after each session I would “backup” this “incomplete downloaded folder or something”- and then again the next day would continue on downloading from that backed up folderI know backing up games that has been downloaded completely is possible through steam, but I’m not sure if it’s possible on the “downloading” ones. And if it is, I don’t know how as of the moment.Any solutions/suggestions guys?Thanks a lot! Ps.

Use Steam Guard, it completely prevents credential stuffing attacks. (However, you will still be vulnerable to any sophisticated phishing attacks)2. Use a different email address from other sites. If gmail, changing mymail @ gmail.com to mymail+steam @ gmail.com will still go to the same inbox.3. Use a different password from other sites. Password managers help a lot.4. check if your email is in any recent leaks on haveibeenpwned.5. (This sounds shady, but it's not. However, only do it if you are comfortable in your understanding of why it's ok.) There's an open source simple implementation of haveibeenpwned's password API here https://junderw.github.io/pwcheck.html . You should open it in a secret browser tab and double check the HTML and javascript in the console just in case. But it will check your password against the known leaked databases without revealing anything about your password. An explanation of how it works is here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/pwned-pw#how-can-i-trust-the-api-server-hint-you-dont-need-to(The reason I recommend this site over the ""official"" site is that haveibeenpwned's site has so much javascript from outside trackers on it, any one of them could be monitoring the password box... secret tabs disable extensions, meaning the open source one is easy to verify no extra javascript is listening.

So I found if you actually add Twitch as a non steam game, Change the Name and Icon to what ever you would want, under launch options you would copy and paste the URL associated with the shortcut, which then tricks Steam into launching Twitch with the said URL.

Entering my password only gets me to know it's actually wrong. Same on the browser site. Trying to recover my password asks me for a steam guard code. So here is where i started panicking - grabbed my phone just to see it's logged out from the mobile steam as well (thank god it was still generating security codes somehow). Got into my account again and noticed the email was changed too. Switched it back to my email but things did not end here. After a couple of hours i got a notice that I (i clearly did not) have requested a self-lock on my account and it's now locked from a bunch of features. For the unlock it required a code that was apparently given on the lock request which i did not do. Anyway after a few more hours of correspondence with the support team (thanks a lot to these guys!!) i got my account up and running as usual again.   But now i\`m scared. I\`m genuinely scared to drop any money on this account. And dropping all my progress to start a new one doesn't sound much appealing tbh.   Bunch a question that come to my mind if you folks can help me with:  Did they get access to my steam guard to change my password and email? No need to mention that i've ran multiple scans on both my pc and phone but no results.   How was the self-lock requested? I mean did they get an email with a link to it after i reset my password or do they still have access to my account even after the changes?   Is there any other security method i could add? I have a phone number linked but it seem to be only good for proving ownership to the steam support. I\`m not a trader or anything so i never log my steam on these sites.

And to do it ASAP. And no, I'm not saying to decrease % cut that they take from game developers and publishers. Valve can't do it.

I'm not a business person, but in my honest opinion, such publishers and developers should be banned from steam forever. Along with all their games. At very least, Valve's ToS (a.k.a.

We have played a few of the real big titles on consoles, but there are so many games on Steam I really don't know where to start. Also, is steam the only major marketplace for games?  Sorry if this post is not supposed to be here. I'm just trying to be the cool dad and give my kids a new experience. I figured I would just get a steam gift card and let them go nuts but i would still like a few ideas from the experienced players here. Thanks.  p.s.- One of my favorite games is Rocket League and i play it on PS4. Is there any major in-game difference in quality that would make it worth getting for PC?;False;New to PC games as of yesterday- looking for some recommendations;https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/aydpfj/new_to_pc_games_as_of_yesterday_looking_for_some/

[All has been said here](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/06/07/valves-abdication-of-responsibility-over-steam-is-the-worst-possible-solution/) .   If the store would have gotten only 20% of the development resources the failure of Artifact is, I think things would surely look different now.  When I signed up for the service 14 years ago, I couldn't have imagined sharing this platform with outright porn, promotion of sexual violence against women or worse. If there would be a way to transfer my game library to another distribution service, I would by now. But I'm locked in, thanks to your monopoly like position in PC game distribution and no legislation enforcing transferability of subscribed licenses.  Part of the reason subscribing to steam back then was thinking, I could simply let my future kids play my games without worrying too much. Now I have kids and I have to take significant active measures to prevent stuff like ""Rap℮ Day"", Alien Hardcore Invasion or SinVR to pop up on the store page, you're doing something wrong. Tags are also still not working and broken.  I'm simply not OK with how the Steam store curation, or nonexistence thereof is handled lately. That's the state things were when I signed up for the platform while you unilaterally changed your side of the offering after the fact.  To give an analogy, if you sign up for any club or party, and suddenly they decide to let any nut job go an stage, would you still want to be associated with them? Or even worse, let them keep your lifetime licenses to your subscribed game catalog hostage? You wouldn't.   Start a spin-off company or at least a sub-brand, if the fringe ideology of free speech absolutism (aka ""reactionary"" approach) in a partially kids market really is your mission. If your business goals absolutely have to include unvetted and no QA content, could you at least add them to another catalog, I could easily unsubscribe from (possibly even under another brand or client as said above)?   I increasingly used other gaming platforms over the last two years and avoided purchasing steam keys via the store because of that and the time waste going though tons of unbelievably uninspiring direct access submissions. I did not miss much.   The unusable state of the steam community market and rampant valid key revocations by rogue devs are not adding well to the picture either. Steam is an unguided once loved cash cow wandering off fertile lands, while their Cowboys are looking for new riches in competitive gaming, GaaS and micro-transactions.  I wish I could still recommend Steam as I did years ago, but unless things here change for the better, I'm forced to only use it to the amount I have to, to access my subscribed games or redeem licences purchased elsewhere.

I did get it to launch once by setting it to windows 8 compatibility meaning the graphics are turned all the way down. I'm running an HP Omen I7 processor 3.60 GHz, 16GB of ram with a Nvidia 1070.

1551708532.0;False;ax7ij2;True;False;t3_ax7ij2;2;False;/r/Steam/comments/ax7ij2/language_popularity_on_steam_english_vs/;4;According to the latest [hardware survey](https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/) English is still the most popular interface language, but Simplified Chinese isn't far behind - and while the former is dropping in popularity, the latter is increasing.  There was a big shift last month - if you assume that the rates will remain exactly as they are (which they won't) Simplified Chinese would become the most popular language used on Steam around August this year.  In reality it'll probably be a bit later than that - but it will happen eventually.To be clear - I'm not saying there's anything wrong with this, I'm just saying that *it is going to happen*.  Whether anything changes as a result is a completely different question.

So I accepted a random friend request because the profile had 200 hours in CS:GO and the bio said: looking for friends to game with.    Next thing I knew I received four ident messages within one hour and a half. So I screen shot it and instead of uploading it to imgur bc paranoia, I drag'n'dropped it to a guy I talk with fairly often and reported the profile. So that idiot of a steam friend has two accounts and decided to log on to the website because it said you can get PUBG (he knows better than that). Then he told me his account got hijacked (phone/email changed) and I should watch out for that guy getting banned/deleted. He turned off Steam guard so trading was frozen for whatever time it's frozen. I thought to myself well he seems like he knows what he's doing, likes to show incentive and likes to troll people.Steam support told him: provide last payment method or CD key of a game. I knew the CD key thing but I wouldn't have thought of it even if he had asked how to retrieve an account, I thought he knew what he was doing.After some time he wrote me how he will sell his primary account because it looks like he won't get back his account and basically f*** Valve. He then provided some screen shot of a trade between his accounts and eventually got his account back.The phishing account is still active but I guess Steam doesn't want to alienate (potential) customers.anyway thank you steam;False;Thank you Steam! 2.0 [hijacked account];https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/axkw7x/thank_you_steam_20_hijacked_account/
