I've had the phone since launch, and it seems more of a nuisance than anything else. The simple things they could've done like stretching Google maps so it reaches the edges would've been a good feature but nope. (Landscape mode)Maybe being able to turn off the notch and just have notifications up there, nope. Having anything useful that come from the notch? Nope.(Maybe copy the LGV10 kinda deal where it has quick tools or quick apps?)I'm not gonna say I have great ideas for it, but come on. It's my first phone other than a Samsung, and I feel disappointed. The horrible battery life, the 4gbs of ram, the notch. It all makes me feel like I made a bad decision going with this phone. Not sure if anyone else feels this way, or maybe there's a way to get some new features out of the notch that I don't know of. (I recently turned it off out of just being bored of it being there, but I want a reason to use the extra bit of screen that's there. The only thing I don't regret, the camera.

It basically uses Google Maps and geo-tags that users input, working in a similar way to Panoramio, but with YouTube videos and videos from other websites. The site has been going since 2014, but still not many subscribers. Each time I go to the website, there is a counter saying how many new videos are linked. I'd say that around 200 are linked per day, and the total is now over 700,000. This is something that I thought of setting up a couple of years ago, but without the time or knowhow, it would have been impossible... It looks pretty good though, and I've shared all my location based YouTube content to it.

But the real pain point that highlights how important this feature is, is first thing in the morning. Start of the day, opening my email, I have around 100 messages that I can easily scan and dismiss, or pin/snooze, by bundles of related topics. Doing the same thing in Gmail is immediately more complicated and time consuming, as each email, or at best each conversation, needs to be individually selected before it can be actioned.I have tried using filters and labels in Gmail to achieve a similar workflow, but it just isn't anywhere near as ""nice"", or efficient.So, who else is living the bundle life? And how are your Bundles set up? And how are you going to live in Gmail without it?I'm asking because it occured to me that maybe I've got this all wrong, and I'm missing how it's supposed to be done. And that's why it hasn't been implemented in Gmail yet. So, here's some info about how I have bundles set up...For scope, I am SysAdmin at a tech company.I have over 100 Bundles set up. Around 20ish Bundles are for people. This is so I can see the history of topics and conversations I've had with someone each time I get a new message from them. Not just the thread of conversation on an individual email chain, but all (non-archived) messages to/from that person, which is immediately available in my inbox, grouped and collapsed, in-line, each time they send me a new email.Most of the rest of the bundles I have configured are for each of the different service providers we have. For example there are bundles for anything From:@dropbox.com@salesforce.com@microsoft.com@booking.com@amazon.comEtcSome of these have further more specific bundles. For example, I have a bundle for ""Salesforce Account Manager"", and every time we get a new AM (which is actually quite often) I easily add them to the rule for that bundle. Which means I have the history of all conversations with all AMs immediately available in my inbox, in-line, as soon as a new message comes in.Etc, etc... So, I've tried setting up filters and labels in Gmail to do the same kind of thing, but it's just clunky at best.

I have 3 email accounts that I use regularly: a personal gmail account, a work gmail account, and a imap-based email account set up for my side-business. I have three separate apps handling these: ios' Mail app handles my business emails, the Gmail app handles my work account, and I have Inbox for my personal account.&#x200B;What I enjoy about this setup is I can see at a glance (with badges) which email has a notification, I click the app icon, and instantly I'm looking at my inbox for that account. There's no account switching inside the app.&#x200B;The bad news is, Google is shutting down the Inbox app at the end of this month. This means my beautiful setup will also end, and I'll have to open the Gmail app and then do two taps to switch email accounts each time I want to check both emails. I know, it's a small thing, but I want to keep a similar setup to what I have.&#x200B;I've looked into it a bit and it seems there's no way to create two separate icons for my accounts in either Mail or Gmail. A possible fix would be if I can find a third party app that intelligently handles Gmail's bundling like the native app does.

This would essentially give (potentially) every person who wanted one a free console that they can play anywhere, seems to be the easiest way to onboard, as well as what would make it available to the most people. Questionable whether Google could make enough from percentage cuts from sales to make it as profitable as they would want. Netflix Style:10-15 bucks a month, you can play anything you want. I can see why this would be attractive to some people, but I think if they do this the service will be Dead on Arrival, because it doesn't solve the chicken and egg problem of having enough games at launch to warrant this which will make more users which will incentivize more games etc. I would not use this service if this is the route they take.(Worst option for consumer) Subscription + Paid games:The worst of both worlds, you have to pay a monthly fee AND buy your games outright like you would with a console. I can see how this would be attractive to some people but for me this also would make this even more DOA than the previous option.;False;What Pricing system do you think is most likely for Stadia?;https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/b3b952/what_pricing_system_do_you_think_is_most_likely/

I did NOT want to enable the ads, and recall clicking ""disable"" many times, but managed to forget at some point and saw that I have incurred $430 in ad expenses over 2-3 weeks. I had explained to a Google Ads customer support agent that I was using Google Ads as a learning tool and did not mean to pay for any service. I had been prompted to put in my credit card information in order to obtain the information required for my assignments.

So say I have 10 kegs of a beer, I would scan them into inventory with the QR code. It would then show it as available. When emptied, we would scan the keg out of inventory and it would move to a dirty status until it is cleaned. Would anyone here have an idea of how to do that?

I've been on Edge (pun unintended) for about a week and I must say I like the cleaner design, and tabs seem to load faster and more fluent, this might be due to the UI of Chrome being written in Java (a slower language). The UI is really what does it for me as the more modern atheistic, and the clean style.In conclusion, the Edge browser really isn't much different to chrome in any way. I found all of the extensions I had on chrome were also on Edge, and the launch time of Edge is significantly faster. Plus, the built in dark theme made me happy.

I have a Pixelbook, Google Home, multiple minis, Chromecasts, am a One subscriber, am part of Project Baseline, develops apps for Android, and on and on.I recently talked my fiance into switching plans to Google Fi and giving up our previous flagship phones for new one through Google Fi (her a G7 and me a Pixel 3XL).2 weeks after getting my new phone the screen stop being responsive when sleeping. Then the buttons stop waking it right away. After a few days it's a good 3 minutes between attempting to wake my phone and when it responds. Try the software fix and nothing works, soft reset, factory reset, nothing changes.Call Google Fi support and they determine it's a bad phone and needs to be replaced. Since we are outside of the 15 day period for a return or replacement, they'll ""offer"" and advanced replacement of a refurb. Not only that but we can either a) send the bad phone in and wait for a replacement or b) provide a card they can put a $1,000 hold on. Well, we're not a credit couple and have one card for emergencies and this isn't an emergency. So we are not offering a card, nor should we have to, this isn't our mistake.Since it's outside of the 15 days I can't return both phones and cancel the account; we're 8 days outside of that window. I'm not calling 90 days after the fact, it's barely a week later.So, right now I am being told that I have to be without a phone or I ""can go buy one to use until the new one comes"". Which I am going to have to do, even if it is total bullshit on Google's part to even suggest that when we've spent nearly $1,600 on new phones.I can't attest to the quality of Google Fi right now, haven't had enough time to use it and I can't attest to the quality of the Pixel 3XL because I hope I just got a bad phone but the TOTAL lack of support for the product from Google is horrible.I just got off of the phone after an hour (yeah, I typed this as I was on hold).and I was offered a $10 credit for my frustrations.DO NOT GIVE GOOGLE FI YOUR MONEY, THEY WILL NOT SUPPORT THEIR PRODUCTS IF THERE IS A PROBLEM OUTSIDE THE 15 DAY WINDOW!I didn't want to believe the review I read here but it is very clear that it is more the rule than the exception.";False;Sharing my experience with Google Support and their protocol;https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/b0ttac/sharing_my_experience_with_google_support_and/

Numerous complaints litter the internet about unhappy customers, people who were promised something and never received, and a complete disregard to the customer as a human.In the latest example, Google Fi recently ran a promotion called “Travel on Fi”. The premise of the promotion involved porting a number to Fi and keeping the service for a specified duration. If these terms were met, Google promised to send the customer a gift card equal to the purchase price of the phone.Now we are dealing with a situation where Google is claiming many users did not port an eligible number, even though they did. The only requirement was the number needed to be active before 8/28/18 12:00 AM PT. Google is trying to claim numbers that were clearly active prior to this date were ineligible. They are even examples of them standing their ground when the customer provides proof the number was active before that date.See discussion and examples about the issue at the end of this community thread: https://support.google.com/fi/thread/643233It’s unbelievable that a company as large as Google can have customer support that is so poor. They really need to step it up, fix the issue, and also fix their approach to customer support. In its current fashion, there is no way Google will survive the cell phone business. They are alienating their customers and user base who have plenty of other options to choose from.If anyone who works for Google is reading this, we would greatly appreciate if you could somehow get this escalated and rectified.EDIT: Story now on Doctor of Credit https://www.doctorofcredit.com/google-fi-gift-card-promotion-issues/;False;The Worst Customer Service: Google Fi;https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/b0mwfl/the_worst_customer_service_google_fi/

Now I know I could just email the link to them from the computer or find the link on my phone and then copy and paste it from there. But I just thought it would be really convenient if your copy/paste clipboard transferred over devices (if so desired!). I can see how this would be difficult between certain browsers or devices. However I have a Google Pixel 3. So would it be impossible to imagine that you could share a clipboard with say a Chromebook or any other computer if your using google. I see it being similar to how I can search something on my phone and when I go on my computer it shows that I had searched it in because it is my Google account.

My Apple Airport even my ISP router offered up in excess of 350 mbps in the downstairs office!&#x200B;* The thing has only x2 network ports and the 1st one is taken up by plugging in the cable from your internet router / modem!&#x200B;https://i.redd.it/pb69ywnaoal21.png&#x200B;**This google router has a fair number of good points, but are overshadowed by the poor network / wifi performance from a single device.**  Granted, this is a mesh wifi device, however spending £100's extra on additional hubs just to get better coverage and potentially performance is not justifiable, especially since even my ISP provided router *(Virgin Media Superhub 3.0)* provides the same performance as my existing Airport router in different rooms / floors.I will admit, the functionality to configure the device from an app was kinda cool if not useful and other family granular controls again were well implemented.In conclusion though, for anyone who wants overall WIFI performance / throughput over convenience and gimmicky controls...

We're miles away on very different wifis, but I'm a ""Home Member"" of her home as well.So I'm not sure how that happened. Yesterday, I ""cleaned up"" my mom's ""Home"" because there were two separate homes that her devices were on and I corrected all of the rooms and I put all of her Google Home Minis in a speaker group called ""All Speakers"" so one could say ""Play \_\_\_\_ on all speakers."" My home also has an All Speakers group. I'm a member of her home as well as mine, but they're different homes with different rooms. This morning, she tells me that around midnight last night, her Google Homes woke her out of a sound sleep with sirens, which were the intro to a rap song. I recall that around the same time last night, I played a rap song on my Homes that started with sirens. I remember because they startled my girlfriend. I think the music paused shortly after and we started it again later. My mom says \*she\* paused them and then it started on its own again later.

1552107621.0;False;ayzw4y;True;False;t3_ayzw4y;1;False;/r/google/comments/ayzw4y/goodbye_google_assistant/;1;Background: I'm a long time google assistant fan and love tinkering with tech toys.  My phone - a Pixel, my wife's laptop is a Chromebook, our living room computer is a ChromeBit, whole house audio uses Chromecast Audio (I'm still mad that those were discontinued), Google Home in the kitchen and office, Shield android TV in the living room, Nest Thermostats, you get the picture.  I've bought into the Google echo system.We recently started building a new home, so I'm revisiting my decisions.  The main reason we are building the new home is to allow better mobility for my two kids in wheelchairs.  They are super smart kids, but just have significant physical mobility challenges.  We are putting in things like smart lights, video monitoring, a ceiling lift system to save Mom and Dad's backs, wide hallways and a fun therapy room.One of their challenges is that they have high palates which makes it hard for them to pronounce certain letters.  Unfortunately two of those letters are K and G... which makes it really hard to say oK GooGle.  I really like the Google assistant better than Alexa, especially how it integrates with our other devices, like phones and calendars, so I have been trying to work with Google on approaches to make it work for kids like mine for well over a year.  They gave me hope mid-last year that they had something working in their office to support different wake words... but this has never materialized.Recently I signed up for Google 1, the fully integrated service to unify support across Google platforms.  So I thought I'd try to see if they could help with our issue.  After calling into the Google Home team, and speaking with some really nice people (they are super nice), they suggested that I have my kids tap the top of the google home to wake it up.  Good idea, but my kids aren't very mobile, so reaching out and tapping a voice assistant to wake it up isn't really an option.  Their second suggestion was to say Hey Bubu.  While this does avoid using the letters K or G, it just isn't very reliable, even when I use that command.  I'd say they have about a 1 in 5 success rate in triggering Google vs nearly a 100% success rate when saying Alexa with an Echo.So now I'm at a loss.  It appears we have landed in that niche place that Google assistant doesn't support.I'd love to hear anyone's ideas on how they would work around or through this issue.  I'm just a few weeks away from needing to  purchase my smart-home equipment and I'm  pained about the idea of needing to switch to Alexa devices.Would love everyone's ideas.;False;Goodbye Google Assistant;https://www.reddit.com/r/google/comments/ayzw4y/goodbye_google_assistant/

Product manager can be a difficult job, a job that requires technical expertise combined with an understanding of the economic and product marketplace, an understanding of the industry as it applies to products, and the ability to effectively communicate their vision for a product.In my experiences at Google it is rare that any of the above listed functions is being performed at an acceptable level by Product Managers within the various groups - and there seems to be multiple reasons, none of which should be in any way a surprise to management, but somehow, im guessing they will be. For example:1. Ladder transfers - The majority of PM’s i have worked with over the course of the past 6-7 years have zero training or experience in product management - and instead are transfers to the PM ladder [both from external and internal sources]. These transfers present unique problems because of related issues below…[and to be clear these transfers to the position are put into bad positions by the points laid out below and are essentially destined to fail, through no real fault of their own]2. General Incompetence - The PM’s that i have had occasion to work with have demonstrated an inability to do even the basic tenets of the position. They exhibit no ability to write even the most basic of product requirement documents, have no concept of ownership as it applies to being at meetings, discussions, reviews - unless its a management review. Often the engineering teams are forced to rewrite the requirements so that we can actually get started on the work - for which the product team has already agreed on an seriously aggressive timeline with management, placing the project at risk from day one, creating an environment of defeat for those involved in the actual engineering; often forcing engineering to work ridiculous hours to complete the project on the timeline that was submitted without technical involvement. 3. No career growth education/training - Any mature and productive group requires a plan for ongoing career growth and education/training. I have seen zero of this in the product groups i have worked with. The PM’s do not grow as there is no opportunity for them to learn how to properly do the job, as far as i can tell its because even leadership doesnt know how to do the job properly. No framework exists in any of the groups i have worked with where the PM’s learn the proper approaches and outputs to being successful and working well with the engineers. 4. No standards - Product managers are supposed to produce several deliverables - most notably business/product case justifications, requirements, roll out plans, commercialization approaches and roadmaps. Each PM has a different approach to each of these items - even within the same Product group. The documents are disjointed, incomplete and fairly worthless from an execution perspective. I have yet to see a complete requirements document in my time at google, and then predictably the PM disappears on some trip somewhere rather than completing their work. 5. Little to no business/industry knowledge - as PM’s its their responsibility to be forward looking and being able to extend industry knowledge and trends into product and feature enhancements over time. The PM’s i have worked with 1. Dont come from the industry, 2. Spend little to no time on understanding the industry and what is coming from a product perspective and 3. Only act in a reactive manner to product changes from other companies. This approach creates chaos across the engineering groups since we are constantly reprioritizing and having to beg for resources to accommodate late priority additions to the requirements. 6. Poor Leadership – see above. How about some training? How about some leadership?7. Attitude – as PM's move through the ranks at Google – they invariably become hostile and condescending. Often moving from producing horrible deliverables into a role that is solely building presentations for executive reviews, largely walking away from day to day product management and placing their teams in bad positions, then backfilling positions with #1. wash rinse repeat.8.

I discovered this new feature hours from home, in a city I didn't know, while joining a freeway at 70mph. A little pop-up I couldn't read that said something about the service. All I wanted was Google maps, a feature I've been using without issues for years, to tell me if I needed to stay in the interchange or join the highway proper.   So this new not unlocking feature came to me at the worst possible time and as you can imagine was not well received.   Then this morning I need to set multiple alarms for my schedule throughout the day. I've been in this current job 7yrs. First thing in the morning I look at my calendar and set alarms for all my meetings and appointments through the day. Every alarm means I should be heading to something. It's kinda how I run my day.   So I 'Ok Google' my Pixel which so far has gone from charging on the nightstand to my pocket to my desk. I pick the phone up as I use the assistant to set the first alarm. My usual process is once the assistant is on screen I hit the mic button for each subsequent command instead of repeating 'Ok Google' 15 times. This time once the alarm is set the assistant disappears and all I see are my notifications. I'm required to manually unlock the phone or moronically repeat the key word for each use. At this point what is the point of having the assistant?   So what is the point of having the assistant if everything useful requires that the phone be unlocked first? If I have to actually touch the device it becomes useless to me in every situation where I currently use the assistant. I may as well get a voice controlled Garmin for the car, use Alexa at home, and shift to Cortana and Outlook at work.   Tech needs to be convenient and preferably transparent to be useful. If Google can't meet these requirements what's the point of using the assistant?   This has mostly been a cathartic rant. I'm still super pissed that I was mildly inconvenienced by something I've grown accustomed using daily. But honestly what's the point in this shift? Force users to not use any security on their device? To stop using the 'Ok Google' service?
