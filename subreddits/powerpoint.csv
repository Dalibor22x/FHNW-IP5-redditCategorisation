This background wall is a canvas and on this the PowerPoint presentation will be displaying said sponsors and some small info on them (8 sponsors, one slide with all of them and then one slide for each). This presentation will go all day (replaying)So, I have been given the information that the canvas is approximately 15 meter wide and 8 meter high.The projector they have displays an image ratio of 16:9.So for the questions;1. Will a PowerPoint slide be able to show the logo without losing quality on a canvas of that size?2. Should the logos be a certain file type? (guessing PP cant handle .ai files(?)) 3.

Recently, I've been trying to create a presentation with voice recordings built into the presentation itself. These are not external audio files, but are audio files that are recorded directly into the slides. Originally, when I created the presentation, I checked the playback of every audio recording and everything worked fine. Then the next day when I came back to check the presentation over again and show it to somebody for review, every slide after 5th slide with narration had the audio recording so accelerated that you could not understand it. I've not been able to find a way to slow down the existing audio and all of my searches pull up information on how to record audio, not how to control audio playback speed. It appears that the original recordings are still there, just that they are getting played back so quickly you cannot understand them.Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, I recently tried re-recording a lot of the audio clips and it seems like this issue is still occurring even once the audio has been reported.Thank you!;False;(Question) Powerpoint voice over playback too fast to understand.;https://www.reddit.com/r/powerpoint/comments/b3h82x/question_powerpoint_voice_over_playback_too_fast/

I work with special needs clients at a work program.  The clients check a PPT schedule every morning to see what they have for the day (work, an outing, etc.).  The Powerpoint is set to scroll automatically in powerpoint mode.  Some clients are having trouble understanding when to report to their assigned activity due to difficulty telling time.  We discussed inserting a timer into the powerpoint that we activate 15 minutes before program starts so that they have a countdown.  I know how to put a timer on a single slide and have found templates for it, but our schedule as it is auto-scrolls (one slide is for the clients who are working, one is for those who will be in a class, one is for clients on an outing, etc.).  I am wondering if there is a trick to make the timer ""stick"" or carryover to each page as it scrolls automatically.  I can't think of any way to make that possible but thought I'd ask the internet!  If it comes down to it, we can probably just put the entire day's schedule onto one slide, but it will just make everything really small and bunched up, making the clients have to work harder to locate their name.

Our organization uses these documents over, and edits them as needs be for each subsequent usage. Each text box follows its own rules, and font formatting, box formatting, and pretty much everything else is all over the map slide-to-slide.Is there a way to change formatting, perhaps through search-and-replace, across a document, for all text boxes? I know this would not cure all ills, and there would need to be a lot of attention given to each document by hand afterward, but it would save a lot of repetitive work.
