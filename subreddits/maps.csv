I am trying to do some research on my family heritage and after my mother, things get a touch hazy. Her father (my opa) was born illegitimate, meaning he only knew his mother and not his father. This in itself is more a question for a different sub (any help determining which sub would also be hugely appreiciated), however, because of both Worlds Wars, my opa isn't sure where he was even born! I'm sure in his younger years he knew, but for whatever reason, he never relayed that information to my mother.I  guess what I am asking is for any reference to an Eastern European village or town named Porozow (spelling may be different) in either modern day Russia, Belarus, Lithuania or Poland.  He was born either January 1st or 14th, 1918.Again, greatly sorry if this is prohibited by the rules. Thanks in advance regardless!";False;Looking for an old Eastern Europe map?

I did this by splitting the map into a square grid, then any subsquare with at least 50% land I kept and anything with less than 50% land was removed. Then I took it a step further and labelled each pixel with the country that had the most area inside each pixel. The result was rather surprising! I decided to make a quiz out of it since I enjoy them:[here](https://www.jetpunk.com/user-quizzes/176412/pixelated-europe) if you’re interested in that.—If not, then the results are as follows. Out of 279 pixels, these countries had the most:* Russia with 76* Norway with 18* Sweden with 17* Ukraine with 17* France with 17* Finland with 16Also, perhaps surprisingly, some small countries made the cut, including Slovenia, Montenegro and Moldova, which just happened to line up perfectly with the grid. Also some larger countries are barely represented, like Greece, because much of the squares around it were cut due to lack of land.I’m not sure it’s overly useful, I just found it interesting.;False;"""Pixelating"" the map of Europe";https://www.reddit.com/r/Maps/comments/advqzs/pixelating_the_map_of_europe/

My business partner, Howard Bronstein, and I created the [Hobo-Dyer Equal Area Projection Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobo%E2%80%93Dyer_projection) (Howard is the 'Ho', and I'm the 'Bo'. Mick Dyer was our cartographer in the UK). We've been selling maps for 20+ years with ODTmaps. Our mission has been to use maps to teach people to see the world from a broader, more inclusive perspective. [We're actually pretty close to how xkcd described us](https://xkcd.com/977/), especially in believing the world needs a revolution in consciousness! Before we hand over the keys, w[e're giving away a bunch of our printed maps,](https://manywaystoseetheworld.org/collections/free-maps-and-more) as well as many [free resources you can download](https://manywaystoseetheworld.org/collections/free-downloads). The two of us are approaching 70 and ready to retire ... so ODTmaps is for sale! We've had potential buyers, but none so far have shared our vision. We'd really love to find a group that shares our idea that maps can help expand our view of the world, and our place on it. If you know of any investors or entrepreneurs who are as excited about maps as we are, we would love to hear from you. My young friend who got me to make this post also suggested we do an 'AMA' to talk about my interviewing Arno Peters (of the Peter Projection map) in Bremen Germany, and why & how we ended up creating the Hobo-Dyer map. Would any of you want to hear a retiring map publisher tell some old stories?
