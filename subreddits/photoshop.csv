It doesn't do much for a change and you can always switch to normal or advanced if you prefer.* What I've seen the most often, the smooth settings in your brush preset. I did not like the idea but it can help. * Also the spacing option in the brush settings can help (in addition with other things usually).*  Disabling scattering helps too, and make sure your power settings are set to max performance.

Strangely it's working properly for the paint tools (Brush, Paint Bucket, etc.).To test this, open any photo, add a Solid Color layer, and set its blend mode to Saturation, and selecting any color with S = 255, one would expect to put all of the image's colors to full blast, right? Also, since we're selecting to affect Saturation only, the H and B values should be ignored.Well, feel free to try it. The S value only maps properly to the image if you have a Hue value of 90º or 270º. If you select 0, 180 or 360º for H, the image is completely desaturated and the S slider does nothing. Also, moving the B slider appears to have the exact same effect as moving the S one.To put it more clearly, let's compare it with the effect of an equivalent brush.Add a Solid Color layer and fill it with 100% red (a normal layer filled with the same color works the same). Now set its blend mode to Saturation and check the result.Now hide the Solid Color layer, select the Paint Bucket tool, set it to 100% red, its blend mode to Saturation and its tolerance to 255, and click on the image. Now we get the expected result: colors to full blast.Now, I won't go into it but, the Hue and Color modes are equally broken.Am I missing something here?Thanks in advance.;False;Hue, Saturation and Color layer blend modes broken in CC 20?;https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshop/comments/b2se1q/hue_saturation_and_color_layer_blend_modes_broken/

I think (but am not sure) that this is due to the way ""save as web"" saves separate slices. it places them inside a folder called ""images"". i think that photoshop is overwriting the ""images"" folder everytime a new image is processed into its 100 slices.i dont see an option in the ""save as web"" tab to remove this structure. how can i approach this problem?thanks in advance everyone";False;automating tiling of photos into 100 separate images;https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshop/comments/b25oxm/automating_tiling_of_photos_into_100_separate/

I recently acquired a white toner printer to produce t shirts via transfer paper. The designs come out great but with certain designs I get a line of each of the printer colours around the edge of my work. Just one thin line along each side in each of the colours (ie magenta along one side etc). I also experienced a very thin line if yellow down one side of each letter of red text in another design.Anyway, I contacted the guys I get the transfer paper from and they seemed to think it's to do with anti-aliasing (which I'll be the first to admit I know nothing about). They suggested ""saving your designs with anti-aliasing turned off"". Does anybody have any idea how to do this? Google has left me more confused than when I started!Many thanks and sorry for the long post.EDIT : I resolved the issue with text (it was set to sharp, so I changed it to none) but am completely stumped in how to remove the semi-transparent edges of an object.

Im a traditional artist mostly and I do some digital art but not a whole bunch. I use Procreate and Photoshop. Recently I decided to put some art on products on Redbubble. Now, Redbubble gives minimum size requirements for each product. So for example their size requirement for an Art Print (which ill be using probably the most) is 3840x3840. Now that's a square. What if I have a piece of art that is vertical. Does that mean it's impossible to make it 3840x3840 without cropping the art piece? and if I fit into a 3840x3840 canvas that means it'll be stretched and distorted right? What if I made sure the height was 3840 but obviously the width wouldn't be 3840, so does that mean it'll print really badly on the product? with white canvas lines to the left and right of it?&#x200B;That brings me to my next issue. Im not sure if my software is glitching or maybe its right but I click on Image > Resize canvas and it'll say the canvas is 3840x3840 for example. but the image that's on the canvas is very clearly smaller than the canvas but when i click on Image > Image Size...the measurements in the box say 3840x3840...but how is that possible when the image is smaller than the canvas size? &#x200B;and my last question is: if you were to break it down into the most fool proof, dumbest down way of speaking, how would you explain when and when not to have the resampling check box checked off? Actually editing photos in photoshop isn't difficult for me as i know how to use those tools...but sizes, resolution (DPI and PPI), resizing up and down, pixels, pixelated pictures....its all just really confusing to me. Like, I go to Image > Image Size and make the resolution 300 DPI and then I export as a JPEG...but when I click on the info of that JPEG file it says 72DPI. I thought I exported it at 300DPI? So should I not even change the DPI in photoshop and just do it somewhere else? Should I be making my art canvas on Procreate a certain size? &#x200B;I apologize sooo much if this is a very long winded, confusing post.

These images are all similar and as follows:- a white, crenulated sample, centered- a completely dark backgroundWe're investigating shape differences and use mathematical tools to extract the outlines and compare them. This involves first inverting the pictures so that the background becomes white and the sample completely dark.However we noticed that some of the outlines are failing to be extracted properly. The reason is that our tool uses a simple threshold value between whites and darks to determine where the shape contour is, but due to their organic nature some of the samples have brown to dark mouldy spots that become white in the inverting and screw the outline.In Photoshop the lasso tool has no issue finding the proper shape almost instantly, no matter how bad the spots, probably because it doesn't rely solely on a threshold value.I'm planning to select these samples and then just fill the detected shape with black, so that the outline extraction works without issue. But I don't really have the time nor the motivation to skim through all 4000 images to look for spots and correct them.So here's my question to the most experienced users. Is there a way (maybe via actions) to have Photoshop automatically detect these white shapes in all of my pictures and fill them with black? I could then run a batch for a couple hours and get my pictures ready for the mathematical treatment.As a hobby photographer I do a lot of editing but sadly most of it takes place on Lightroom.

This problem seems to be specific to Adobe products: Photoshop, Illustrator, and Animate/Flash all have this problem. Essentially, if I put the pen down on the screen and start drawing, it works fine. However, if I lift the pen off the screen, it seems to think I'm still drawing so if I hover the pen over the screen without even touching it, it will continue to draw lines, forcing me to double-tap the screen to stop the line from being drawn. It's almost as if the initial touch on the screen permanently toggles the Paintbrush tool on and double-tapping it toggles it off. I can't just do what I want and only draw lines when I'm actually touching the screen.As I said before, this only happens with Adobe products. FireAlpaca, GIMP, and even Microsoft Paint work fine in terms of this issue and never continue to draw lines after I've lifted my pen off the screen. I've googled this, and while I've seen many issues Ugee 1910b owners are having with Photoshop, they mainly seem to be dealing with pressure sensitivity when it comes to the thickness and opacity of lines, not the issue I'm having.I would greatly appreciate any help that anyone can give me. I don't think it's a driver or tablet issue because it only happens with Adobe products, so I don't know if there's some setting I can change that I'm missing.

The vertical lines angle outward from top to bottom.  In order to square all of the lines, I can apply perspective warp in photoshop, but I have to do this manually.  The reason I'm doing this instead of shooting straight on is because I want to fill the frame with the building facade.  However, maybe this is just a bad idea and I should try shooting straight on - this is part of what I wanted input about.&#x200B;Hi.  So there is a cool building near me that I want to photograph but for various reasons it needs to be done in a stitch.  I don't own a perspective correct lens and I don't really want to buy one so I have to apply perspective warp to each of the images of the stitch before combining them.&#x200B;My first question is: is there an easy way to do this?  Photoshop itself will not recognize the need to do the perspective warp (or at least I don't know how to make it do that), so it seems I have to do this manually.  Further, it seems I have to do this manually for each shot, AND I need to make sure that the resulting images are scaled correctly in order for the stitch to line up properly.  This means I would have to do the perspective warp correctly for each of the images manually, and be very careful about it, which is time consuming.  Is there an easy way to do this?  Or is this just a very difficult task?&#x200B;My second question is: when you are doing a stitch and then a subsequent HDR, I think it's better to stitch all images of the same exposure first and then HDR the stitched images together.  Is that correct?  If so, how do I apply the exact same edits from one stitched image to generate the other stitched images?  In other words, I want to do the perspective warps to all the images for one stitched image and then apply the exact same perspective warps to the other images to make the other stitched images of different exposure.&#x200B;Thanks!";False;Advice for doing a stitched panorama when you also need to do perspective warp on each image;https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshop/comments/avrq84/advice_for_doing_a_stitched_panorama_when_you/

Whenever I set Opacity Jitter to pen pressure, it's impossible to make an opaque stroke, even when I'm pushing at maximum pressure.&#x200B;The effect I would like, is to be able to range my opacity from 0% to 100% simply based on my pen pressure. If I make a single stroke across the page, starting as gently as possible and ending at maximum pressure, I would like the stroke to begin fully transparent and end as an opaque/fully black line.&#x200B;I've tested this in multiple different pieces of software - Krita, Paintstorm, Corel, MediBang and Firealpaca - and it all works fine, but in Photoshop, it takes about 8/9 strokes over the same spot just for it to become a black line. It seems to be limited to something around 40% opacity.&#x200B;[Here's a comparison of the effect in Paintstorm compared to Photoshop.](https://imgur.com/a/LnjLEce)&#x200B;Minimum opacity is set to 0% under transfer , and I'd like the maximum opacity to be 100% (but of course there's no setting for that, so I'm not sure what to do.) If I set minimum opacity to 100%, then of course I can reach 100% - but then I can't make any transparent strokes no matter how lightly I press, which defeats the objective. So minimum opacity has to stay at 0%.&#x200B;If I use the mouse it draws at 100% opacity, and same if I turn transfer off - so I know that both brush and layer opacities are set to 100%.&#x200B;I've tried the following .txt file fix in the settings:\# Use WinTabUseSystemStylus 0But that didn't work, and I've also reinstalled the Gaomon driver and Photoshop itself, to no avail.&#x200B;I've raised it with Adobe support and they weren't able to find a solution, but it has apparently been raised and I'm awaiting an email.

I purchased a set of cassette inserts that come 4 to a single page. The template is below.https://www.duplication.ca/printspecs/jcard/cass-jcard4bspec.pdfSo, at this point all I need to do is get 4 copies of my cassette cover template onto this 4 panel template to print out. The issue is that every time I try to do this the image gets blurry. When I duplicate the layer of the full cover  template into the project with the 4 panel template it comes in gigantic. Like 5 times as big as the actual template which I don't understand because it is clearly 4x4 inches and the 4 panel template is 8.5x11.What do I need to do to resize this original cover to fit the 4 panel template? I keep resizing the cover but it comes in blurry every single time and I don't get it. I can't really start from the 4 panel template either because when I shrink the cover image the same thing happens. As far as I can tell I am resizing but there needs to be some sort of resampling going on. I only have access to CS2 unfortunately but I feel a though this shouldn't be that difficult. The actual print size of the cover template is exactly what it needs to be and so is the 4 panel template. but the image of the cover template is massively huge compared to the 4 panel template and resizing just blurs the whole cover.
