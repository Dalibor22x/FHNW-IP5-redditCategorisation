We have a set of jigs that have been 3D printed for each product. In order to save time when we print, the company we get the jigs from have sent us action files to use to place the logos we are printing in the appropriate spot after we align the 1st logo. For Tile Mate trackers, we print about 160 units at a time. The jig holds a grid of 20 x 8 units. We haven't seen any issues until we started printing full bleed.So, here's my issue/question: ***Is there a way to change one step within a series of actions without having to completely recreate the entire set of actions?*** Basically, when the first move action to the right starts it is short by an incredibly small amount. When printing just a logo, you can't tell there is a slight change. All one through twenty look good. However, when you print full bleed you can start to see the shift. By the last unit, number twenty, you can see there is a significant shift in the print. So, is there a way to simply change one move file within the recorded series of actions?I appreciate any and all help I can get. I've been working in Illustrator for eight years, but do not know how to do this.

It's enough for my needs.Lots of things have changed over the years, naturally, and I've been able to figure out and adapt, but I just discovered one change that I can't figure out.It used to be, you could draw your shape on the artboard, select it, then choose an effect (e.g., ""Twist"") and your shape would be appropriately modified. You then had free reign over the handles and could continue to modify the shape as you see fit. Now (CS6), however, when I do that, my shape *is* appropriately modified but there's no access to the handles. Instead there's just a bounding box which, yes, I can modify but not how I want.Example: I draw a rounded rectangle; four straight lines, four curves, eight anchor points. I apply the ""Flag"" effect and my straight lines (two of them, anyway) are now appropriately curved. In the past, I could have used my direct selection tool, selected just the curved line, copied, and pasted, and gotten a copy of just that curved line which I could tweak as I saw fit. Now when I do that I get the original straight line.WTF?Where did my handles go?

Usually I'm able to shift click and the EY dropper will pick up the color from one object and replace it on the object I have selected. Normal.Now, say I have a red square and an orange square. I want to turn the red square orange as well, so I select the red square, and shift click the orange square to grab the color and change the red square. Instead of doing what it's supposed to, the fill color only changes in the side tool bar, and when I open the appearance window, the color is still remaining red.I also noticed that when I shift click, I'm not getting the + next to the eye dropper. I only get the + when i shift-alt-click and even still, it's not working properly. If I had a pattern, for example, I could shift-click and select a particular color within the pattern. Now it just picks up the entire pattern.I'm mega frustrated by this and would love some sort of solution.

I've been designing posters and bits and bobs for a charity over a couple of years now. All of which has allowed me to stay firmly within my comfort zone - Photoshop.Recently they've asked for a 4 Page A5 brochure for an upcoming event. I agreed, but now that I've got to work I've realised I haven't a clue about what I do when it comes to getting it printed.I just can't quite get my head around how the pages will need to be arranged when it comes to printing. So there's 4 pages of course with two sides each, which means there's 8 sides (8 art boards). I currently have 8 separate art boards, 2 of which for the front and back covers and 6 for the remaining sides. What are my next steps with the 8 separate art boards? Are the printers able to take and arrange/layout these separate art boards in the desired page order (if i send them off in Ai format, PDF or Tiff is probably preferable)? Or should I not leave them as separate and join two appropriate (A5) art boards together so that they can be printed as one (A4) sheet that can be folded in to two pages?I've expressed my concerns to the the people that asked me to do this but they're pretty clueless. I assume the printers (if asked) should have given them some instructions as to how the pages should be presented to them when it comes to handing the files over for them to arrange and print?I'm aware that indesign exists but unfortunately I don't own a copy.Any help will be greatly appreciated, thanks!;False;Been asked to design a Brochure and I have a couple of questions when it comes to arrangement for printing.;https://www.reddit.com/r/AdobeIllustrator/comments/ayti37/been_asked_to_design_a_brochure_and_i_have_a/

And this works fine because I am the one deciding the distance. But let's consider a different scenario: one guy gives you an old project, where there are lines of text perfectly aligned and all with the same amount of space between them. You need to edit some lines of text, and maybe you go from 1 column to 2 columns, so you will have to regenerate the spacing between all the text objects. The problem is: HOW do you get to know what spacing was being used between these objects? Expecially if it's a value like 10,414 mm, there is no chance you can guess it.I'm trying to solve this problem... Basically I have already all these text objects set up, I need to find a way to understand what spacing was being used. And it's not easy, because the X and Y coordinates are based on the object center, and you can't get the coordinates of the 4 boundings because they are not anchors and you can't select them for text, so you can't even use a calculator. Or better, you can find the distance (I managed to do it drawing a rectangle and aligning it in the space between the objects), but it would be pointless, because you wouldn't be able to align the text objects anyway since X and Y coordinates are based on their center, Smart Guides don't work and you can't select the 4 anchor points which you can see as their boundings.TL;DR: Look picture here below, I don't need to find the distance value, just replicate it somehow, so if Illustrator has some ""magic"" function to replicate the distance between Object A and Object B also between Object B and Object C, I would be fine with that. So, instead of taking a spacing defined by user as input, calculate it on these objects and use that instead for all the objects selected.[https://i.imgur.com/9kDjUgu.png](https://i.imgur.com/9kDjUgu.png)";False;Get distance between two text objects?;https://www.reddit.com/r/AdobeIllustrator/comments/axh12h/get_distance_between_two_text_objects/

I have done exactly what he says in the video:1. Make rectangular grid using the rectangular grid tool2. rotate 45 degrees, then via the transform window changing the height parametre to exactly 57,54%.3. Used the shift and alt key to scale the grid to fit to artboard.  I will attach a super professional image i made in paint, but it shows what happens.  I have tried different guides with different % in the height parametre and different angles as explained, but they have not worked.&#x200B;The pen line will cross ""exactly"" (?) in the middle of the intersections on some, and then it will miss the intersection, then coming back to crossing the intersections ""perfectly"".  It seems like the percentage I use is making the intersections lean, but that does not explain when it goes back on track just some intersection in between.  Do some of you know what's wrong and what i need to do to correct it?

I often have to generate svgs and ai8 files with variable data for laser engraving; our lasers accept ai8 and svg (ideally I need a solution for both).&#x200B;So currently I use indesign to generate the variable data, export it as a pdf, and then open that in illustrator. The main issue is that indesign -> pdf does not preserve groups so I then have to manually go and regroup everything. When dealing with 1000's of objects this becomes very tedius very quickly. Lastly I have to seperate each group into its own layer because the laser software is inconsistent, sometimes it understand groups properly, sometimes it doesn't, there doesn't appear to be any rhyme or reason to this. This is easy to do with the ""build to sequence"" function in AI's layers though so no biggie.&#x200B;I have found that if I create a group in illustrator and then copy/paste it into indesign that the grouping is in fact preserved when exporting it back to a pdf. I do not know how this is handled internally in indesign. This is not a solution however as I need the variable data to also be included in the group so I'm still left with the original problem. If I could find a solution or better work flow to this it would save me so much time in the long run. I watch jobs come in that used to be 30 sets of data grow and grow and I know we're going to reach a point where it's simply not feasible to touch all of these things manually as I currently have to do.&#x200B;I am on CS5 by the way.

Whenever I use the shapebuilder tool to join shapes, they move a bit. This is a problem and I have no idea why it would do this. I noticed that the shapes sometimes lock on to pixel grids that I can't seem to turn off and are not helping me place my shapes at the correct place. If I want to place it exactly where my mouse is and then it jumps over to what seems like a random location, usually very far off where I want the shape to be. I figured that was because of the pixel grid option, which I now turn off for every shape. Still, the moving happens after joining shapes with the shapebuilder tool as can be seen in the figure attached below: The left one is before using the shapebuilder and the right one is after they're joined.

My father is a graphic designer.  With corel anything is simple to make and I feel like from centering a vector to the page to just reflecting a shape, corel does best. Don't hate me on this I am starting to like Illustrator. I like the tools and some stuff that ease your work (like graphic styles) but (a big BUT here) I need like 5 tools to make something I would make in Corel in a matter of seconds. From Corel 12 I believe and the using heavily throughout my life Corel x4 to x7 (these are the versions not dates) I just love the fact that I can do most these things I imagine in Corel.They have added since 12 I think a feature that while you drag an item and you left click it copies the item and if you let go the right click while moving it it pastes your item where you left your click. (i hope it makes sense to you).Or when you just want to reflect you hold the item from the left and drag to the right holding the ctrl button. That was less that a sec mirroring. In Ai I need the tool!The C button centers the 1st selected item to the 2nd selected horizontally and the E button centers it vertically. So pressing these to centers 2 vectors together. The button P centers EVERYTHING to the page. Everything. Like I dont get all the fuss pressing 3 buttons on the alignment panel and before that selecting align to artboard. It just makes my life harder.Here comes the best part. Direct editing of images using Pathfinder. Dear god that must be the best part. Cropping an image or trimming it or even intersecting it. Yes I want to do that in most my works. I want to make a path using the pen tool and remove a part of an image.But image editing is handled by Photoshop which is great. Anyways, these some things I do on a daily basis. Is there an option or plugin to actually change Ai to your liking?

Might be better to import afterward into Photoshop for the gradient (let me know if I'm wrong about that).I've tried starting this shape with a simple circle, and then I use the pen tool to draw the tallest flame shape on top of the circle. I use just 1 point for either side of that flame (not including the top point or tip of the flame), and then I basically eyeball it to have it curve and meet the circle with a single point on each side. After that, I close the shape.I do sort of the same thing with the bottom left and right swoops, drawing a shape with the pen on top of the circle.I then take the Pathfinder tool and either unify or divide these shapes up, but I seem to never get it right. I can see that you would have to do this for two different sets of circles, and then punch some of these shapes out at different sizes to reveal the underlying yellow gradient.

I got this job to design a mural that will be printed on vinyl and installed for a wall. I did the design using illustrator because of the vector aspect so there would be no loss in quality if printed large. I already did the design and they liked, but I have to make some revisions before sending to the printers. Before starting, I converted the wall space (11' 3/4"" x 7' 9"") to inches and put those inches for the dimensions of the artboard. I am concerned if this was a good way to insure the design would fit on the wall exactly. The ai file is not large at all. I am not experienced in printing, as I am not sure if I should make room for the bleed or not, or if it even matters in this case.

From browsing various jobs there seems to be many people posting work for very little money. Just wondering if it's worth competing on sites such as this? I've always been pretty set on the whole ""you get what you pay for"" mindset and I get that kind of vibe here.5) What's the best way to present your portfolio to potential clients?Again, sorry for so many questions.

I had it set to export based on the artboard, which is currently sized to my desired dimensions. However, after I set it to export as a 300ppi PNG, I'm finding that the resulting dimensions are now way too large. After doing some math it seems to be increased to make it 4x larger, or basically the difference between a resolution of 72 and 300. In order to get this to work, I had to resize my artboard to 24% of it's original size, manually resize my art and re-position it in the artboard. Even with all that, it finally exports out close to where it should be, but it's still a pixel off due to some rounding issue when the size is getting increased. I double-checked and my ""Document Raster Effects Settings"" is currently set to 300ppi.It appears like Illustrator is working in a default resolution of 72. I just don't understand- I thought that Illustrator being a vector program meant it had no working resolution per se, and that any project could be exported as you wished.

I'm not even sure if with AI I can make something close to what I did with PS, but I need to get as close as I can.The logo is going to be placed on the vehicles so it needs to be a vector logo and also if he will need to put it somewhere else, they will probably ask him the vector logo with no RGB o pixel stuff in it (my english isn't really good so I'm trying to make it simple, sorry for the poor language).So tl:drI made this logo with PS.

The cut line shows up as ""path"" and the safety line shows up as ""anchor"" in Illustrator (light pink lines).    What I want to do is be able to center my text or image (both vertically and horizontally) within the cut line so that it is exactly in the center. The front panel has only the image and the back has only the text, so it should be pretty simple, I think.

At my old design job, I learned the way of never doing so and getting the most quality out of manual tracing. I only recently acquired Illustrator for my personal use, and I have a very complex drawing that was started in Photoshop with the pen tool > rasterize as I go to simplify process. I drew this on a 15x15in canvas @ 300ppi and have yet to finish. Before doing so, I would really love to find a way to get this back into vector, but so far, every attempt of mine has been trash. Here is a zoomed in picture of the lines I’m working with - the image looks aliased/jaggy in illustrator, but they are all very smooth technical lines in the original art. Far too much in the full drawing for me to want to trace tbh :/https://imgur.com/a/p8MZaUNI thought to myself, there has to be a way to salvage this for a vector output. Please don’t ask me why I didn’t start this in vector initially, it is because complex pen lines do not work the same way as they do in AI and I had to rasterize as I go. Every line here is crisp to the pixel, but there are some very detailed areas and repetitive patterns made up of tiny objects. The jagged nature of diagonals at-the-pixel in such patterns may cause problems, sure, but I’m getting nothing remotely faithful so far.Is there a way/setting to achieve nearly, if not perfect representations of “technical” drawings? (the technical preset isn’t vibing right either) It’s pretty much a blueprint without a use for the real world, and is drawn in such a way.If not AI, is there a better system that could achieve a vector I can then import back into AI?Any help is seriously appreciated. 🖤;False;Achieving a [perfect] live trace?;https://www.reddit.com/r/AdobeIllustrator/comments/aj89o0/achieving_a_perfect_live_trace/
