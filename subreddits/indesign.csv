I'm working with an Epson r2000 sylus printer. Like I said in the past it has worked making everything 5x7 from the project itself and the input/output paper and checking the borderless option. Now when I set it up like that it's cutting off the top and the left side of my project when printed. I've gotten it to be close to where it needs to be but there is a white border on top. I'm trying to make some flat note cards on glossy paper but no matter what I do it cuts it off or gives a white border on one side or all the sides. It would be a huge help if anyone knows why this is happening. It's for work and we are a small time paper store that does custom printing. I'm some what know what I'm doing but sometimes these sort of things come up and I don't know why. I would greatly appreciate it. I've even searched online and could find anything that works.

Any notes or suggestions you have on how I could do this better for future projects would also be greatly appreciated.*I'm currently designing a Christmas brochure. Most of the decorative assets (snowflakes and baubles) have been hand-drawn, imported to Illustrator to create vectors, and then given a texture fill to replicate a glitter effect. Because I didn't do an artboard per asset, I used Illustrator's Export feature to export each group in to an individual SVG file (the only vector format I could see from the Export file options).Whilst a number of additional design elements (backgrounds, textures etc.) will be created in Illustrator, the final brochure will be completed in InDesign. For each page of the brochure there will be a background image, a layer of text, and then a handful of decorative snowflakes and baubles on top.Currently (as above) the snowflakes and baubles are .SVG  but I gather that SVG is designed more for web and not for print. What is the best format for me to save these in to balance usability during editing and final print quality?

The main issue is that indesign -> pdf does not preserve groups so I then have to manually go and regroup everything. When dealing with 1000's of objects this becomes very tedius very quickly. Lastly I have to seperate each group into its own layer because the laser software is inconsistent, sometimes it understand groups properly, sometimes it doesn't, there doesn't appear to be any rhyme or reason to this. This is easy to do with the ""build to sequence"" function in AI's layers though so no biggie.&#x200B;I have found that if I create a group in illustrator and then copy/paste it into indesign that the grouping is in fact preserved when exporting it back to a pdf. I do not know how this is handled internally in indesign. This is not a solution however as I need the variable data to also be included in the group so I'm still left with the original problem. If I could find a solution or better work flow to this it would save me so much time in the long run.

We have subdirectories for each edition, and another layer of folders for each section (News, Features, Opinions, etc). Article authors write their articles in Google Docs. Our section editors make the necessary changes to the documents. **We'd like to keep this process, as it works well and isn't technically challenging** (low barrier to entry for writers and editors)**.**The text from those documents is then copied (1) onto our WordPress site and (2) into InDesign, where our layout team pieces together our six-page print edition. Here's where it gets tricky.Tools:* three aging iMacs (might soon be upgraded)* Creative Suite, soon upgrading to Creative Cloud* A relatively large budget (at least this year)Putting together six pages (while adhering to our design and brand guidelines) is rather laborious, taking anywhere between five and eight hours. This means that we split typesetting between two or three people.We've been able to split the labor in various ways:* 3 individuals, 3 iMacs, 2 pages per individual. Three PDFs are merged at the end to form a 6-page edition.   * Pro: concurrent work   * Con: throwing articles (page 1 story continued on page 3) is near impossible      * Therefore NOT a good solution!* 2-3 individuals working in shifts using one InDesign station.   * Pro: we don't worry about transferring files   * Pro: all contained in one file   * Con: detailed communication is required during shift change   * Con: not concurrent      * Therefore this takes forever!* Haphazard combo (what we've been doing this year):Individual 1 starts layout on their personal laptop well in advance. Individual 1 sends a 70-80% complete copy to Individual 2, who then adds content via our iMac station. Individual 2 sends back to Individual 1, who makes visual tweaks and sends to printer.   * Pro: semi-concurrency   * Con: INDD -> IDML conversion (will be fixed with CC), loss of assets, messyThe obvious con to splitting the labor is that the print edition is subject to inconsistencies, but hey, we're all busy students who need to split the work :)\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Question:** Can InCopy help us here?

For many years, we have been doing this manually. For instance:1. Copy a page of text from a Word document.2. Paste the copied text into a frame in InDesign.3. Look at the Word document and find any text that is bold, italic, centered, indented, etc.4. Manually update the InDesign file to match the formatting of the Word document. In other words, if we see bold font in the Word document, we will go apply our Bold character style to the corresponding text in the InDesign file. If we see that paragraphs have tabs in the Word document, we will apply a paragraph style in InDesign that contains a first-line indent.Our InDesign files are very text-heavy and don't contain many graphics. We do use quite a few tables in our files, but they're not extremely complicated. Most of our work is very basic typesetting.Due to the huge volume of work we have that involves this process, transferring content from Word to InDesign and manually formatting the character styles is very, very time consuming. We have researched ways to automate this process but we have not been able to find a reliable way to do this without having to do a lot of manual overrides.
