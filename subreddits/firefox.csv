Very convenient feature. However on some websites, this function is broken, and middle clicking opens the link in the same tab, the same as left clicking. If you want to open a link in a new tab, you have to right click the link and choose Open Link in New Tab. Some examples of sites that do not work correctly:- Any Instagram page, such as: https://www.instagram.com/sweetvalleybooks/- Any Shutterfly page, such as: https://www.shutterfly.com/photo-gifts/pillows- Any Pinterest page, such as: https://www.pinterest.com/pin/744431013377655662/This is very inconvenient when wanting to open lots of links in new tabs. Also even more inconvenient if you don't know ahead of time that a particular site has this issue, so you middle click expecting a new tab but it hijacks your existing tab instead. Does anyone know how to fix this? I am not sure if this is a Firefox bug, or if certain websites are definitely blocking this feature, but either way I would like a way around it.

[link](https://old.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/b3vic4/browsing_in_2019_is_ridiculous/)I thought I'd provide a general overview what can be done with a couple of easy, simply steps that don't take longer than a couple of minutes to activate, and basically make browsing with Firefox free of 99% of anoyances on the web, while basically completely preserving funcionality of the browsed websites:**Step 1: DNS-Filtering**Setup a DNS filter on your system. This takes care of most ad-domains on your entire system and not only in your browser. It also makes sure most ads are still blocked when you have to disable your browser based ad-blocker for some reason.Use AdGuard DNS (https://adguard.com/en/adguard-dns/overview.html#instruction) for a quick and easy way or install pi-hole (https://pi-hole.net/).**Step 2: Firefox settings**- Control permissions in Firefox: https://i.imgur.com/RWD63gD.pngForbid all sites to ask you about accessing camera, microphone, location and notifications.- Deactivate auto-play of audio: https://i.imgur.com/5fUNlrq.png- Activate Tracking Protection by default: https://i.imgur.com/h2N9g0i.png (while this is obsolete with uBlock Origin, it is a good fallback for sites where it is for whatever reason necessary to deactivate uBO. Tracking protection and AdGuard DNS make sure that most ads and tracking are still blocked even when uBO is not in use for a single site. Just like AdGuard DNS, Tracking Protection has been designed to cause basically no breakage.- Deactivate Mozilla ads/snippets: https://i.imgur.com/krlMi5P.png**Step 3: Ublock Origin**- Download and install uBlock Origin: https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/- Activate all annoyance-filterlists: https://i.imgur.com/d7XGPUP.png (the social lists are optional, they remove all kind of social buttons from the web, which are often unnecessary and track users. The Anti-facebook is optional as well and will break facebook-based comment sites and may also break some facebook apps or games.)- [Download](https://www.i-dont-care-about-cookies.eu/abp/) the ""I don't care about cookies"" filterlist, and import it into uBlock Origin: https://i.imgur.com/q5gxXyr.pngWith these lists uBO blocks all subscribe pop-ups, ""deactivate your adblocker"" pop-ups, cookie banners and most other annoyances that are created to keep you from accessing the content.Yes, you only need this single extension for eliminating annoyances on the web.If a website breaks, uBO can be deactivated with a single click for that site: https://i.imgur.com/dpul3qR.pngBut even in this case of deactivating uBO for a single site, you are still protected by AdGuard DNS and Firefox native Tracking Protection.**Summary**With this quick set-up (DNS filter + Firefox permissions + uBlock Origin) no fine-tuning should be necessary in most cases, and it makes web browsing a clean, fast and focused experience.If a website doesn't work, the reason is probably that uBO blocks some javascript, and if you are not tech-savvy and don't want to look into the technical details, simply deactivating uBO for that site should take care of the problem.";False;How to survive web browsing in 2019;https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/b44bdu/how_to_survive_web_browsing_in_2019/

I eventually figured out the answer, but turns out it wasn't exactly what I wanted so I was hoping somebody could help me out.What I want to do ultimately:I want Firefox to use a proxy for all web requests. That in itself is easy. However, I also want all the proxy requests to be encrypted in an HTTPS packet with a URL of the proxy server. Basically I want it to look like my device is doing normal web requests to 'https://proxy.com', but it's actually carrying web requests that will be proxied at the server at 'proxy.com'So when FF wants to make a web request, it builds a proxy request for the desired URL and then wraps it in another HTTPS packet destined for 'https://proxy.com' and sends it to 'proxy.com'.What I have achieved so far:I've got a server running tinyproxy and stunnel with a CA certificate for 'proxy.com'. Server-side I have it sorted.However, I'm struggling to get Firefox to do what I want. The normal proxy setting available from the settings options are not good enough. It is not possible to get Firefox to encrypt the proxy requests this way.Exploring a bit further I found that I can configure encrypted proxy requests using a PAC file (Proxy Auto Configuration) so I did that. However, using wireshark I found that whilst the request is encrypted, it does not look like an HTTPS packet. It appears like a TLS packet with encrypted content destined for the IP address of 'proxy.com'. It is important for me that these packets look like HTTPS requests to 'https://proxy.com', because my server is behind a CDN which will only forward HTTP(S) requests.Does anybody know if I can do this in Firefox? I would prefer to avoid having to run some additional software on the client if that's possible.;False;Help with proxy setup;https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/b43mki/help_with_proxy_setup/

I am not talking about informing firefox to make those things work in their browser, in my opinion this may be a lost battle in the long term because firefox and the community my get overwhelmed with time regarding the quantity of little things to fix... but I am talking more about : is there, new technology, libraries, other tools that are as good as what Google and Microsoft promote but are not biased towards those two, that we can switch to it or use it as alternative to what Google and Microsoft provide ?";False;Is firefox under a soft embargo ?

Unfortunately Firefox doesn't support basic AppleScript features that are needed for our Helper app to interact with it.Basically, we use very standard AppleScript functions to connect to another app and ask it for input. That input is then added to a new to-do via Quick Entry with autofill. But if the other app doesn't support those basic functions, it doesn't talk back to us and we can't get any information to add to Quick Entry with autofill.That's not something we can fix our end, this has to be supported by the app you are trying to get information *from*. Unfortunately, that means that our hands are tied in these cases and we have to rely on the developers of those other apps to add basic AppleScript support.&#x200B;";False;Things3 Autofill Task from Firefox;https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/b39xab/things3_autofill_task_from_firefox/

I also really like Opera- mainly because it has 2 really well-designed integrated features that are hard to live without.  **#1. Integrated mouse gestures.**   This makes navigation so effortless and smooth. Firefox has various extensions to emulate mouse gestures, but they don't consistently work. For example, gestures don't work on certain pages, such as new tab, settings pages, and any tab that has firefox.com URL.   **#2. Speed dial.**   When opening a new tab in Opera, my browser feels more like ""home"" because of the customizability options to both the look and features. You can add bookmarks with big thumbnails and change the page wallpaper, add custom search engines, even a News feed. When I open a new tab in Firefox, it opens a white empty page with a gear cog. I find opening a new tab in Firefox incredibly frustrating with the native New Tab options. There is some customization, but it's so limited. There's a setting to show Bookmarks, but my bookmarks still don't show up on the new tab page. I should be able to specify *which* bookmarks show up. (Why would I want all of them?) No customization of how it looks. Just a white background.

My old device, the S4 Mini, has a 4.3 inch screen and 540x960 resolution display. I have faithfully kept it up to date as far as I can and currently it is running Android 7.1.2 thanks to LineageOS. The new device that I have just bought has a 5.2 inch screen and 1920x1080 display. Unfortunately, this device doesn't have any custom firmwares available and I'm stuck on Vanilla Android 7.0.You would think that a larger screen is an update but so far for me, not so much. Using LineageOS's bigger set of options when it comes to display size, Firefox looks like [this](https://i.postimg.cc/1Rr91nZq/Screenshot-20190315-215231.png) for me on my S4 Mini. As you can see, the menu is nice and small, I have access to my tabs at the top of the screen and can easily drag and drop them around and manage tabs that I'm not even focussed on. Also, I have a lot more buttons in my address bar to make use of without needing to open up the menu.Now, with this brand new device has basically has twice the screen size and resolution of my S4 Mini, [this](https://postimg.cc/4Kz4RxVk/810db2bf) is what Firefox looks like to me now. A complete downgrade. Everything looks comically huge and cartoonish and comes across like it was made for old people that can't see nicely or obese people with fingers the size of pork sausages. I no longer have easy tab management except through that awful tab menu piece of crap thing that you guys have going and I no longer have extra buttons on my address bar.

And I honestly have to question certain people's intelligence that they didn't think to make the tablet UI an option for ordinary phone users long ago already.

It’s called Firefox Send, and it allows anyone, regardless of the browser they’re using, to send files. As a bonus, the files are encrypted, and can be set to expire.Firefox Send isn’t completely new. We first heard about it in August 2017 when it was one of a trio of experiments conducted as part of **Mozilla’s Test Pilot program**. But now, after 18 months of testing, Firefox Send is available to everyone.&#x200B;## How to Use Firefox SendAs detailed on [**the Mozilla Blog**](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2019/03/12/introducing-firefox-send-providing-free-file-transfers-while-keeping-your-personal-information-private/), Firefox Send lets you send files up to 1GB in size. This is bumped to 2.5GB if you sign up for a (free) Firefox account. Despite the name, Firefox Send works with any web browser. All you need to do is visit [**send.firefox.com**](https://send.firefox.com/).Once you land on the site, you simply drag and drop the files you want to send or select the files from your device. You can then set the files to expire after a certain length of time or number of downloads. You can also protect the files with a password.&#x200B;[https://youtu.be/eRHpEn2eHJA](https://youtu.be/eRHpEn2eHJA)&#x200B;Once you’re happy with the files you want to send, click **Upload**. You’re then given a download link to copy, which you can share with your chosen recipients any way you want. Whether your files are password-protected or not, they’re end-to-end encrypted.Anyone you send the link to just needs to click on it. They will then be whisked to Firefox Send, where they can click **Download** to download the file(s). It’s simple, effective, and intuitive enough that it could even be used to send files to non-tech types.## Err on the Side of CautionMozilla is also one of the more trustworthy companies out there, with its [**Private by Design**](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/11/firefox-sync-privacy/) philosophy and promise to [**keep your data private and secure**](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/). However, we would still recommend erring on the side of caution when sending sensitive files.There are, of course, plenty of other ways to share files online. You can send a file via email, or a cloud storage service such as [**Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive**](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/dropbox-vs-google-drive-vs-onedrive-cloud-storage-best/). However, Firefox Send makes the process so simple it’s hard not to be impressed by it.&#x200B;source: makeuseof&#x200B;";False;Firefox Send Lets You Share Files Online;https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/b12kxz/firefox_send_lets_you_share_files_online/

At any given time I have a good 4000-5000 tabs open spread out over a good 20-30 windows.  I use the automatic tab discard extension in order to intelligently manage what tabs stay loaded and what gets unloaded every hour, and that's worked wonders for me, however, when it's time for me to switch contexts in my workflow (look at tabs belonging to a different project), i switch firefox windows, but usually all the tabs in that window will have been unloaded because they haven't been used in a while.  To combat waiting for tabs to load, (especially when i just want to load them to close them or find something specific among them), I've taken to using the ""reload tabs in current window"" extension, and then walking away for a bit (perhaps another coffee, perhaps a trip to the restroom, etc.) while the tabs load because it bogs down the whole system when i do this (1700x overclocked to 3.8ghz, 32gb ram, rtx 2080ti, 500gb nvme ssd), and sometimes some of the tabs \*still\* refuse to load with ""connection timed out"" messages which is unacceptable!  I know that firefox can optionally do lazy tab loading at startup (loading whatever foreground tab you're looking at first, and then load 3-5 tabs at a time in the background until they are all loaded), but I can't seem to figure out how I can make this happen when I reload all the tabs in the window.  Is there something i'm missing?  Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can do this? - my hope is that i can reload all tabs in a page, and it'll do the lazy tab loading so that it maximizes my computer's resources to loading just a few tabs at a time, doing it properly and quickly allowing me to a. use my browser when i refresh all the tabs in a window at the same time, and b. avoid problems with network timeouts in tabs by only loading a few at a time before moving on.

This is a setup that essentially exists on both desktop and mobile. I've long advocated that groups should live in the cloud, so that I can access said tabs from whichever device without needing to duplicate tabs by default, but that's another discussion. But without permanent tabs, how does one work? Tabbed browsing is different things to different people. For me, it's the ability to manage my day/week/year. Outside of the pinned tabs, the closer you get to the middle (on desktop) the more important the tabs are, and those tabs on the periphery are temporary tabs that are there to remind me to check them out or come back to them. On mobile, it's the same, but towards the bottom. I guess I'm curious about how this vision for tabbed browsing works?

There's lots of talk about how WE is ""the way forward"" (a gimped road that you need to pull gymnastics to switch lanes in, but still goes forward it seems) but most people promoting Firefox seem to simply shove their heads in... the sand, regarding the fact that Firefox has lost a lot of power and control from a user point of view and that, for many workflows, *52 is still the better choice* no matter how much they wave the flag of Security. It does not matter how secure a program is if it does not allow me to perform the tasks I need to use the program *for*.Now, since I've waited for more than four years and I've not *absolutely* lost faith but also I'm not as stupid so as to trust Mozilla blindly with their marketing interest, lest with all this noise, I wonder, in this year of 2019, if there is any central place to follow the measures that Mozilla is taking to reach back to *at least* feature parity with the old Firefox versions? Is recovering that feature parity - themes, sound, keyboard hooks, save-as, a long etcetera- even on the table anymore?A few pointers on stuff that I've tried on both 52 and 60 and that I've managed to read about, but that I can not find a good centralized place to follow development and improvements on:* A number of add-ons have been so reduced in their functionality that I feel they should not keep using the same name so as to not lie to their users. ** DTA is a shadow of its former self, the homepage speaks of stuff like horrible save performance and loss of important hooks.** Foxyproxy also a shadow of its former self but at least it's more solid, still, it lost lots of ease-of-use over the WE switch due to the loss of stuff like access hooks.** Save-pages addons can't even into *save* anymore it seems (no MAFF, no MHT, not even ""zip file of page contents"").** No Self-Destructing Cookies -the real thing, not half-assed attempts to port. Dunno if this is missing APIs or what, I haven't been able to find good documentation on that.* No RSS. In 2019. Like, really. I'm wondering what should I expect to be dropped for the next ESR. Maybe FTP support? Non-Latin font scripts? Print mode?* **No ALSA support out of the box** - apparently you need to compile FF yourself to even test the potential capability. This is a showstopper for any browser that will potentially hit eg.: Youtube on Linux.* Big elephant in the room? Theming and customizing the browser area. * Down to the mechanics of the browser itself: While not as bad as Chrome, I do feel Mozilla *wants* Firefox to be a Chrome. It does still needs 12 more processes and about the same proportion of more RAM to do the same job that Firefox 45 ESR did some years ago - let alone Opera Presto which could load ~60 tabs in ~400 MB RAM. Now, I hear about something something webrender, but so far my 2015 Lenovo laptop is not impressed.At the moment the best options I am feeling are staying on FF 52 ESR or using Seamonkey 2.49, but both of those are only as good as Mozilla's direction to sooner than later work *with* the add-on developers and deliver a good browser version again. I've heard of 56 but last I checked it's not an ESR, is it any a good option to stay on? I certainly don't think latest non-ESR versions are much of an option given that they are still on practical terms *alpha software* when it comes to the ability to extend the browser.";False;It's 2015+4.

Hovering over a link such as ""/r/example"" might display `https://www.reddit.com/r/example` in your status bar, but clicking on that link might actually take you to a URL like `https://www.reddit.com/r/example?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=example&utm_content=bull5h1t`. Google search results are other prime examples of this crap.In my opinion this presents a security and privacy risk. The status bar is a simple and quick way to check the target of hyperlinks; but since that target can easily be changed upon clicking the link, the status bar ""preview"" suddenly becomes totally useless.I believe browsers should not allow hyperlink targets to be changed dynamically from what is displayed in the status bar.

This is because I need to research if I was infected by something or not.I'm gonna explain what happened to see if I can get more details.I was using Firefox 56 due to a specific add-on that is not available on the new version.The night before the problem, I noticed that firefox was closed but still opened up as a service. I think it was nothing serious, that it just freezed, so I closed the pc and I went to bed. The next day I wake up with the flu, so not in the best mental shape. I opened up the pc and firefox is still running as a service but it can't open its GUI. I right-clicked on the firefox service in the task manager and I clicked on ""open folder"" and it sent me to a .tmp file in a folder in the firefox folder (C:Program Files\...). The folder was full of .tmp files, called something like ""undeleted"" or ""temporary"". It was a long name. Sadly I wasn't really in my best shape, so I didn't write down the name of the folder and of the files, so I could research them and see if it was a symptom for a trojan or some malware.In the end I just installed the new version of firefox and rebooted the pc.
