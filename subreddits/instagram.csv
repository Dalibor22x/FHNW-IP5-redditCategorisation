No business, all personal. I’ve been in a dilemma trying to figure out what to make my username. Real name: I’m the only person on this earth with my name, so if anyone sees it they will know it’s me. For example “tomjohnson”Username: I have something somewhat creative, nothing that’ll be crazy to other people but I like it. For example “tj87”Now, with my real name I think it’d be easier for people to know that I’m on IG by seeing my name. But it might be more annoying giving it out in real life. With the username I think it’ll be difficult for anyone to know it’s me, unless I tell them about it beforehand.  I don’t know a whole lot of people on IG so it may hurt the follow count of mine but I think I would much prefer to have my username Bc I’m not sure if there’s any cons to using your real name especially when it’s unique to you and easily looked up. Also, I know there is a username and name section where I could use my “tj87” and “Tom Johnson” but I feel like if I use the name I mine as well just make my username “tomjohnson”;False;Username help: Real name or username?;https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/b4whe9/username_help_real_name_or_username/

And I REALLY NEED your guys' opinion on the app me and friends have been building for 2 years now. I continuously get pissed by how Instagram shows me old photos of people or things that I don't even think are cool enough to be at the top of my Explore feed. So long story short, me and my team made this app called **Carusel**. Here is the download link: [https://carusel.io/](https://carusel.io/) We position it as a content-discovery app where the rating of content depends exclusively on its quality, and not on the popularity of the author. The app increases the chances of finding new interests, getting unbiased opinions as well as trending news, and distributing content virally. *This is how it works:**1. A user publishes the post that is sent to a group of random people**2. If they like the post, they can support it**3. A supported post is sent out to another larger group of people, and so on*The more users support the post, the more people it gets shown to. As a result, only the most genuine and interesting content (as judged by the majority of users) receives the deserved recognition and virality. Users rate the content posted both by the professional and amateur creators so even the newbies in content creation can get the viral recognition they deserve! This is what we used to build the app: AWS: SES+S3+RDS, Docker, Haskell, JSON-RPC 2.0, MySQL, Android Studio, Java, Git, HTML, CSS. **I would be really grateful if you guys could give me feedback** if you enjoy using the app with content being distributed by the “human choice” algorithm rather than the artificial one like in Instagram, Pinterest, etc.? Do you think you would use it on a regular basis like Instagram, Pinterest, etc.?

Thanks to Jane Manchun  Wong and Matt Navarra, we are now informed of some of these new  features.* **Sorting followers on Instagram**First  of all, she revealed a feature that lets people sort their follower and  following lists. Sorting will be based on recency of the additions to  the list. This feature will help users planning whom to connect or  engage with for their Instagram growth, both individual and  professional.&#x200B;https://i.redd.it/26gefza1ttn21.png * **Karaoke feature** She also tweeted  that Instagram has been testing a feature similar to a Karaoke tool  which will probably embed lyrics to music videos. Instagram will use  Facebook’s music right deals to make this feature a perfect win.  Furthermore, the extension of TikTok and the point that a significant  part of its termination is related to the music used in the videos  surely floor the way for Instagram to launch this new feature.&#x200B;https://i.redd.it/iwwejzd4ttn21.jpg * **Co-watching feature** A “Co-Watching” feature is also being tested out for video calls on Instagram,  probably similar to Facebook Messenger’s Co-Watching, but it’s not clear what kind of videos Instagram will support being co-watched. Chances are on video posts and IGTV.&#x200B;https://i.redd.it/utyxvy77ttn21.jpg * **Search bar in likes list** Wong also  tweeted about a search bar to be tested for post likes. The feature is  being examined for Android, as iOS users already have this feature.&#x200B;https://i.redd.it/f67e0a3attn21.jpg * **Direct media pickers** Instagram direct is also working on an advanced media picker feature. If this option  rolls out successfully, you will be able to find “Saved” and “Liked  Posts” tabs on your personal profile and a “Your Posts” tab on your  business profile.&#x200B;https://i.redd.it/1jyiejucttn21.jpg * **Rating business profiles** After Wong’s exciting revelations, Matt Navarra also shared a tweet about a new option in which people will be asked to rate business accounts on Instagram. &#x200B;https://i.redd.it/obs1246fttn21.jpg We don’t know whether all of these features will be rolled out (or not)  and their launch date is also being kept as a secret on Instagram.  However, one thing is for sure that Instagram is trying so hard to stay  ahead of its competition. **Source: Original Content** ";False;Sorting Followers, Rating Profiles and other new Features of Instagram!;https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/b4gotr/sorting_followers_rating_profiles_and_other_new/

This will boost engagement and also force you to choose the better, more brand accurate posts.Any questions!?

The account I used was an old one (almost 2 or 3 years old?) that I had used to test how follow/unfollow worked. Late December 2018 I unfollowed the remaining accounts and started posting with 2750 followers. I knew most of these would be dead, so my plan was to slowly remove inactive/uninterested followers as I progress with my growth (I figured having a few thousand followers would help the new follower conversion ratio). All has been somewhat okay, I started posting and was seeing success. Now I'm currently sitting on 2200 followers, with 2250 of my original following being removed (gained about 1500\~ followers organically).&#x200B;The strange part comes from when I upgraded my account from personal to business. The amount of my existing followers who are reached seems to be fixed at about 400-700, the number never changes unless I rank for hashtags/explore. When I first started using analytics last month I realised that posts would never reach more than 600 or so of my followers, even when analytics was telling me that 1200 of my followers are active daily. Even now when I Have 2200 followers it tells me that 1700 of them are active on a daily basis, posts are barely reaching 400-600 of my following.&#x200B;Do you think it's possible that my account is flagged? I don't understand how my reach is the same or lower, even though I've seen a substantial increase in active followers. My first posts that didn't seem to make it to explore or rank for hashtags gained almost the same amount of engagement as my most recent posts. I don't want to abandon the account, but 3 months in and it seems like I can't even reach my community. You think this is a problem with the account itself? Or am I just falling victim to the same reach/engagement fuckery that a lot of other people are experiencing?";False;Reach is locked at a fixed number?;https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/b3ib5f/reach_is_locked_at_a_fixed_number/

I have found a routine that has taken me to 350 followers 3-4 weeks later. I want to share it , to also get some tips to get some more traction.1) I use an auto liker that likes upto 700 pics a day , based on chosen hashtags.2) I make a new post per week / photo with text content ( was getting 30 likes per pic / now getting 70+ ) 3) 2-3 times per week I jump onto 10 pages I follow and comment on recent pics that have low comments, if I am inspired and I can contribute something genuine.4) I follow back accounts that follow me if I like their page / content ( I am starting to get many 2-10k follower accounts) 5) I comment back to all comments on my posts , if it looks like its from a real account / even if their comment looks generic like it is from an auto comment bot6) I block bot accounts that follow me - the ones with stolen pictures / catfished profile pics 7) I use displaypurposes dot com to explore hashtags &#x200B;I wonder do you have any tips for : 1) Finding / connecting with people in the same / similar niche2) Tips for increasing reach of my own posts &#x200B;Anything else?

As Twitter and Facebook cracked down on external influence campaigns between media investigation, the Kremlin’s Internet Research Agency (IRA) located unparalleled success in changing its disinformation efforts to the photo-sharing app, according to a new report approved by the Senate Intelligence Committee.**On Instagram, the IRA conducted a memetic battle against millions of users by creating a sophisticated and robust network of accounts related to important social justice and political concerns. These profiles weren’t primitive or poorly managed but, rather, part of a well-oiled attraction machine intended to weaponize the social clout used by power users on instagram.>*“Instagram was perhaps the most effective platform for the Internet Research Agency,”* decides the report, written by cybersecurity firm New Knowledge.https://i.redd.it/awjmkmusu0n21.jpg&#x200B;The IRA produced only 135 Instagram accounts. But a lot of these attracted more than 100k followers, generally viewed as inception to mark an account an ""influencer"" almost 50 exceeded the “micro-influencer” milestone of 10k followers. Similar to many American influencers, the IRA monetized its social media popularity by pushing custom-made commodities—giving it access to the customers’ personally identifying data, and developing partnerships with brands.The IRA aggressively targeted black Americans on Instagram as well as the right and left with a coordinated, multi-level influence campaign created by networks of parallel and competitive profiles, which worked in companion to cover users in a highly controlled ecosystem of the Kremlin’s design.The most successful accounts were focused on feminism, black culture, Christianity, LGBTQ+ issues, veterans, gun rights, and collected more than 10 million interactions—engagement such as likes and comments—each. Others represented news breaks and journalists in the hopes of increasing distrust in the actual media between target audiences. The goal, as with much of the Russians’ digital activity, was to increase divisions and stoke hostilities in the US.On Instagram, IRA accounts ridiculed the idea of IRA accounts on instagram. In the track of the 2016 election, up to 70 posts on Instagram and Facebook targeting right-wing audiences downplayed the presence of Russian interference.&#x200B;https://i.redd.it/xorn3ziuu0n21.jpg&#x200B;Starting in 2015, the time explained by the report, IRA-controlled accounts spread 116k Instagram posts, almost twice as many as the 61k posts on Facebook, which until now have gained far more attention. The Instagram posts got more than 183 million likes and 4 million comments, generating more interactions from users than relative Russian operations on Facebook, which collectively earned about 76 million engagements. The report also recommends that Facebook, Instagram’s origin company, downplayed the outsized part of the photo-sharing platform in Russian efforts to seed discord.Instagram’s position was *“something that Facebook executives appear to have avoided mentioning in Congressional testimony,”* the report says.&#x200B;https://i.redd.it/3jg9uehwu0n21.jpg Once these groups account reached a significant mass, they were used to promote stories that increased tensions between groups and seize the conversation among target viewers by showing potential subjects of discussion or judgments from a trusted source — one especially potent example of this strategy recognized in the report centers around a real-life human interest story.The IRA gradually expanded the story of an 11-year-old black boy who obtained national news after creating a device to prevent hot car deaths. IRA-run Facebook pages and Instagram account reframed the story to strengthen racial in-groups: “White people invent tools for killing, this Black child is inventing a tool for saving lives,” stated one post. “these are stories of Black children the media don’t want you to see,” state another. Black Matters wrote an article about the case on its website, which it declared had well over 100k subscribers.**Source: original content** &#x200B;";False;How Instagram Became the Russian IRA’s go-to Social Network;https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/b2u2g0/how_instagram_became_the_russian_iras_goto_social/

For a year now, however, I have not been part of the agency since I quit and now have the following problem: Whenever I log in via the webpage, the first thing I do is suggest the account of the company that I have looked after. The blue button says ""Continue as ...."". Underneath it says ""Not .....? Change Account"". Maybe this seems weird to somebody but it really bothers me, that somehow that account is still connected to my computer or my browser. Before I started to manage that instagram account, my private account always popped up on this login page.

And when I was eventually required to give a phone number, I listed my home phone.  Why did I do these things?  Because years ago I assumed my normal e-mail or cell would get blown up with spam.  Besides, I keep track of my passwords so I never saw a risk of me needing to do a password re-set.Fast forward to last weekend, I was away on business.  During a brief downtime on my trip, I decided to go onto Instagram only for a suspicious login attempt notice to surface, probably because I was on the other side of the country.  I had a lot going on, so I didn't bother verifying at that point.  Now I'm home and realize that it doesn't matter, even visiting on my PC where I was already logged in, it brings up the suspicious activity notice.  I cannot go into my account until I verify my identity.Well I obviously can't log in via the phone number since it was a home phone.  So e-mail it is.Until I go to mail.com, try to log in and realize it's not the e-mail address I thought it was!IG doesn't display the verification e-mail address - it just shows up as:  s\*\*\*\*\*\*\*7@m\*\*\*.comThat's 7 asterisks and that is exactly the number of characters it would be for the e-mail address I'm confident I'd have used.  But I haven't used that mail.com account in several years, and while I have the password written down in a notebook in my home office, my stupid self didn't write down the user name.I tried a few other variations I've used in the past, but Mail does not recognize any of them as valid e-mails.  I wondered maybe IG just shows 7 asterisks but the actual e-mail might have more, but none of the ones I was likely to use worked there either.So yeah, unless and until I come up with the correct e-mail address I have no way of getting into my IG ever again.  I supposed my profile will just sit there permanently like those people who never deleted their MySpace back in the day.  And I'll have to make a new account to start over.Nobody's fault but my own....just figured I'd share my dumbassery for a laugh.

It increased gradually from around 50 likes to 70, then 100, then 150, and so on.  &#x200B;But in my last 3 posts something happened: The first got around 300 (as expected), the second got 1700, and the last one I posted yesterday is around 8000 likes as of now. Curiously enough it's a drawing I posted in my previous account last year, and it didn't get this amount of attention. This is great and all but, I don't think I did anything different this time, the hashtags are almost always the same, varying only due to the theme of each drawing.  The Instagram insights says I got most of the likes from hashtags. I was not featured or anything like that. I'm curious to understand the reasons for this, was it luck with the Instagram algorithms? I don't see any dramatic change in quality of the art compared to my previous posts.

This can either be due to a bug or slip by the user.**In this article, we’ll list the most common reasons why Instagram is logging you out, as well as the solutions to fix it.### Instagram Keeps Logging Me OutThe issue of Instagram logging out usually affects users who have more than one account on Instagram. If you are constantly switching between your different accounts, Instagram will eventually get confused. This then leads to a bug in which you get logged out even when you didn’t want to.**How to fix it?**Here, we have listed the most common methods you can use to stop Instagram from logging you out.**1- Clear the Instagram cache**Clearing your Instagram cache will usually fix this problem. Doing this will refresh the data that Instagram has stored on your iPhone.**Clear the cache on iOS*** Go to Settings > General > iPhone Storage* Scroll down to find Instagram then tap on it* Tap on ‘Offload App.’ Don’t worry; this isn’t going actually to delete the app, just the saved data.&#x200B;https://i.redd.it/vjb90x07gmm21.jpg **Clear the cache on Android*** Go to Settings > Apps.* scroll down to find Instagram* Tap on ‘Storage’ and then ‘Clear Cache.’After following these steps, log back into your accounts.**2- Check your Instagram security settings**Instagram lets you set different stages of security within the app. If you are continually being logged out, you may want to change your level of security to fix the bug. To change these settings,* go to Profile > Settings > Account Privacy.&#x200B;https://i.redd.it/2hk74zs8gmm21.jpg **3- Check for conflicting apps**Sometimes some apps can have an effect on other apps on your device, and even cause them to stop working. If you had installed any new apps before your Instagram app stopped working correctly, try uninstalling them to see if this fixes the issue. This can be particularly possible if the apps you have installed are by a poor developer, as these are more likely to have bugs.**4- Reinstall Instagram**Reinstalling Instagram is the last thing that you can do to solve your logging out problem. The Instagram data stored on your iPhone will be entirely reset. This means that once you install the app again, everything will be completely fresh, and probably, you won’t get logged out automatically again.**5- Change your password*** Tap “get help signing in.”* Tap “username.”* Enter your username, email address or phone number and tap “send login link.”* Once you receive the link, reset your password and log in to Instagram using your new password.&#x200B;https://i.redd.it/z5bhy7qbgmm21.jpg **6- Contact Instagram**If all of these methods above didn’t work for you, and you’re still getting logged out, then there may be a problem on Instagram’s side. Maybe their database is complicated due to your account. Head on over to Instagram’s Help Center to receive some support.**Source: Original content**";False;Why Does Instagram Keep Logging you out?;https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/b22b3l/why_does_instagram_keep_logging_you_out/

Like general videos, IGTV previews will autoplay, but the user must tap it to activate the audio.**The one-minute previews are rolling out this week. Instagram first launched IGTV in June 2018 as a separate app for videos. Since then, the company has been looking for ideas to combine it into the main app, first by placing IGTV Videos in the Explore tab, then by setting out specific notification banners for new videos, and finally by giving us the ability to add IGTV previews to our own stories.### IGTV Previews On Your FeedThis, though, is its most aggressive endeavor yet to trade IGTV content to Instagram users who haven’t hopped into the bandwagon.>“*Now, you can preview IGTV videos in your feed. When there’s a new video from someone you follow, you can tap from your feed to watch the full video in IGTV,”* Instagram wrote on Twitter.**For Creators**Instagram launched IGTV as a way for people to share longer videos on the platform. It’s part of Instagram’s policy to allow authors more freedom, which in turn could encourage them to share more content. It’s also an attempt to take on Twitch and YouTube, two of the most popular platforms for creators and long videos. Content can range from 10 minutes to one hour for larger accounts. However, the platform still seems somewhat lacking in terms of overall functionality and interface, especially compared with what YouTube and Twitch have to offer. Not to mention that most creators recognize its insistence on vertical videos as a hindrance.Creators enjoy individual freedom on Twitch and YouTube, most of which, while today on IGTV, aren’t as elegant or smooth. Still, it’s clear that Instagram wants a stake of the creators market, more particularly the number of people they attract with their content. The challenge is to design a platform that will make them want to stay for good or maybe even leave Twitch or YouTube behind.**IGTV Problems**Since its appearance, IGTV has received criticism on some aspects. In September 2018, it was reported that the platform had been routinely prescribing inappropriate content to users. This isn’t restricted to IGTV, however. YouTube has also received sharp criticism over similar cases of its algorithm showing less-than-decent content to kids, not to mention regular and seemingly arbitrary recommendations of original and collusion theory videos.**Source: original content** ";False;Instagram Is Adding IGTV Previews in Uses’ Feeds;https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/b1p1f8/instagram_is_adding_igtv_previews_in_uses_feeds/

I am NOT talking about the “suggested” segment, where the names appear and have a little X by them. Otherwise I would just click the X and be done with it. When I go to “clear search history” in the settings, this page will still pop up when I type in “A”   Even though my search history is clear. I think simply because I’ve visited the page before Instagram just wants to give me an auto fill of pages I’ve been to before, even though my search history is empty.

You may notice that there’s an Instagram outage for millions of people- and so do I. However, one thing has recently happened that has made me suspect it wasn’t so “accidental” after all. I’m pretty young, have a few followers, and I admit to spending quite a bit of time on it. However, I also have an alternate fandom account that I only check weekly.   I check Instagram, notice that my feed isn’t refreshing, and assume it’s out for me too when I do a little research. However, when I switch accounts, I see that my feed refreshes, I can post- in fact, it’s like the outage hasn’t affected me at all.   This is also affecting Facebook, and I think we’re being subject to something more than an outage- something that maybe, just maybe, be very planned. I’ll edit as there’s more info released.;False;The Instagram Outage- I Suspect Tomfoolery;https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/b0rlpq/the_instagram_outage_i_suspect_tomfoolery/

I've tried it in multiple devices and it still doesn't show that option. And as for my other issue, I'm not able to resize the images i put on my story.
