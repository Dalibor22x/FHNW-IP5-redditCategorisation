This is not an ordinary request; I'll explain.  I need your kind help please regarding helping me transfer my WhatsApp application (complete with its history) from one phone to another. But there's a catch.  All ""conventional""/recommended methods have failed. Here's what I tried:  \- Backing up my conversation history to Google Drive then attempting to restore on the new phone  \- Manually copying multiple ""msgstore.db.crypt"" files from the old phone to the new one and attempting to back up from all of them  \- Deleting all backups on both Google Drive and phone memory and generating brand new ones, then trying all the above methodologies again  \- Deleting all WhatsApp media and doing all of the above steps again and again  \- Waiting 6 months (!!!) and attempting to backup again, doing all of the above steps  \- Making absolutely sure that both WhatsApp versions are the exact same version  \- Making absolutely sure that both WhatsApp versions are the latest version  In all attempts, the WhatsApp restore process fails at 24%.  Now on the bright side, when I (am forced to) go back to my old dying phone, it doesn't even go through a backup/restore process because all the data is already there.

Google Allo was just perfect when it comes to looks; it was so pretty that you wanted to use the app for the sake of it. It had conversation-specific themes, whick were shared among all participants.

I checked my web history and I never Googled or downloaded Life is strange since the last time I deleted my history on new years day. Also I never downloaded in my life Chloe dead and definitely not that dick pic. I searched everywhere even on Google photos but nothing. So I started panicking and I factory reset my phone, I changed all my passwords, deleted my WhatsApp account and payed and installed an anti virus. I think someone was spying on me on my phone in general or on WhatsApp. Now I hope no one is doing that but I still have a lot of anxiety. What do you think happened? Has it ever happened to you?

I have friends abroad who only use Whatsapp, and many friends in this country use it too.  In the UK I can text...and virtually everyone now has unlimited texts so I've stuck to my guns so far.

Does it do as some suggest and harvest data from the phone?No-one seems interested in getting yet another IM app...like Signal or Telegram as they already have Whatsapp and Messenger.

This is starting to get really annoying how the program crashes every single link that I send and wanted to see if anyone else had a similar problem.Here is one link that I found crashes the program for me every time, and I've confirmed it happens in both the 64 bit windows install and the Windows Store version.Use this as a test link: [https://catalog.belden.com/index.cfm?event=pd&p=PF\_70263PU](https://catalog.belden.com/index.cfm?event=pd&p=PF_70263PU);False;Crashing with URL preview?;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/axdsvt/crashing_with_url_preview/

The merger wants to create ‚ÄúThe best messaging experience‚Äù for all of the users around the world who use the Facebook-owned platforms.The platforms will remain distinct from each other, although their underlying messaging infrastructure would be unified. An employee of Facebook said the merger would produce a messaging platform that was simple, fast, private and reliable, though data experts have warned it could have an impact on users‚Äô privacy.‚Äú*We‚Äôre working on making more of our messaging products end-to-end encrypted and considering ways to make it easier to reach friends and family across networks,‚Äù*¬†The spokesperson said. No official statements have been released, but the plan is expected to take place by early this year, as the New York Times reported.The merger is a backtrack on Mark Zuckerberg‚Äôs main stance that both WhatsApp and Instagram would operate autonomously from the *social media platform*. Facebook acquired Instagram for approximately $1 billion in 2012, before taking over the WhatsApp in 2014 for an estimated $19/3 billion. Both platforms have since experienced fast-track growth \_ Instagram has over 1 billion monthly active users, and WhatsApp has 1.5 billion users\_ but all founders of the application have since left Facebook.One of the main concerns with merging the apps could be related to data privacy. Currently, *WhatsApp users* are not required to enter their name or any other identifying information except their phone number to use the app. Merging with Instagram and *Facebook messenger* could force WA users to reveal some information about themselves that they might prefer to keep private. Data privacy expert Tim Mackey told *independent* that Facebook should take care of how the integration handles the firm‚Äôs ‚Äúspotty history‚Äù with user privacy.>*‚ÄúMerging personal information and privacy configurations from three significant applications won‚Äôt be trivial,‚Äù* he said. *‚ÄúFacebook development teams would do well to look at this precedent and prioritize user privacy.‚Äù*  *‚ÄúWith the integration project currently expected to take a year to complete, and with end-to-end encryption as part of the plan, we should expect the Facebook engineering teams to focus attention on uniform data security both in their platform and in the apps themselves.‚Äù*Facebook said in a statement: *‚ÄúAs you would expect, there is a lot of discussion and debate as we begin the long process of figuring out all the details of how this* *\[merger\] will work.‚Äù***What do you think about this merger?

The services will continue to work as stand-alone applications, but their underlying technical foundation will be joined, said four people involved in the process.**That will bring three of the world‚Äôs biggest messaging networks together, which allows people to communicate between the platforms for the very first time.This movement has the potential to redefine how billions of users adopt the apps to connect each other while increasing Facebook‚Äôs grip on users, raising privacy and security questions. It also underscores how Zuckerberg is imposing his power over parts he once promised to leave alone.The plan requires thousands of Facebook employees to reconfigure how Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp messenger function at their basic levels, said the employees involved in the effort, who spoke on the condition of being anonymous because the matter is very confidential. Zuckerberg also wants to incorporate apps in an end-to-end encryption, a big step that protects messages from being viewed by anyone except the members of the conversation.>In a statement, **Facebook** **said**: ‚Äú*We want to build the best messaging experiences we can; and people want messaging to be fast, simple, reliable and private*.‚Äù It added: ‚Äú*We‚Äôre working on making more of our messaging products end-to-end encrypted and considering ways to make it easier to reach friends and family across networks.‚Äù***What is the point of stitching the apps together?**By merging the apps‚Äô foundation, Mark hopes to expand Facebook‚Äôs utility and keep users extremely engaged inside the company‚Äôs ecosystem. That could decrease people‚Äôs hunger for rival messaging services, like those provided by Apple and Google. If people can interact more regularly with Facebook‚Äôs apps, the company might also be able to extend its advertising business or add new revenue-generating services.The plan follows two years of analysis of Facebook‚Äôs core social network, which has been criticized for permitting election meddling and the spreading of disinformation. Those and other problems have reduced Facebook‚Äôs growth and harmed its reputation, raising the hackles of regulators and lawmakers around the world. Zuckerberg has frequently apologized for the issues and has promised to fix them.But the reforms might not sit well with some Facebook users, who have become more cautious about the data the company yields to other tech-firms following a lot of scandals. Last year, revelations showed that UK political consultancy Cambridge Analytica collected the data of up to 87 million Facebook users without their permission. It‚Äôs unclear what user data will be shared among Instagram, Facebook Messenger, and WhatsApp.Matthew Green, a cryptographer at John Hopkins University, raised concerns on Twitter about the information that could be shared between the applications and whether WhatsApp‚Äôs encryption would get less safe. WhatsApp only needs a phone number to sign up for the app while Facebook requires users to confirm their identities, the Times pointed out in its report.https://i.redd.it/xhd0fm71g4d21.pngMerging Facebook messenger with Instagram and WhatsApp might also make it harder for government regulators to break up the company. Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group, said: ‚ÄúIt ties up the company more rigidly.‚Äù ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre doubling down on the fact that they‚Äôre one company. The stakes are higher.‚ÄùFacebook expects the messaging to play a much more significant role in its future. In October 2018, Zuckerberg said an increasing number of users are shifting from posting publicly to sharing privately in messaging apps.**Source: Original Content**";False;Zuckerberg Plans to Merge WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger;https://www.reddit.com/r/whatsapp/comments/aklek8/zuckerberg_plans_to_merge_whatsapp_instagram_and/

Now whether you have iOS or Android, all it takes is just a few steps.&#x200B;The ‚ÄúShare on WhatsApp‚Äù feature has been available on Android for a while now, but iOS is not getting in on the action with a ‚Äúshare to WhatsApp‚Äù feature. However, if you own an iPhone, you may not notice the option because it is currently in a closed, invite-only beta.&#x200B;Before going any further, you will need to have the WhatsApp installed and set up on your phone to share anything from Instagram. Also remember that you can only share public Instagram posts to WhatsApp, which means no videos. Unlike with Twitter and Facebook, you don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúlink‚Äù your WhatsApp account to Instagram to be able to share posts to it. It performs just like Facebook Messenger does on Android. As long as you have WhatsApp on your phone, Instagram will detect it and display you the share option.&#x200B;In this article, we have mentioned how you can share Instagram stories, photos, and videos on WhatsApp. Because WhatsApp and Instagram are both owned by Facebook, there has been much integration done between these apps. Stories like status on Facebook and WhatsApp was mirrored from Instagram stories. To bring these apps even closer, Instagram supports sharing on WhatsApp. Here‚Äôs how.&#x200B;**How To Share Instagram Photos Or Videos On WhatsApp?**The process is the same for both iOS and Android with a few changes.https://i.redd.it/vxszfiu6j5c21.png* Open your Instagram and find the post you want to share on WhatsApp* Tap on the three dots icon on the top right of the photo or video* Select ‚Äúshare on WhatsApp‚Äù from the options.* WhatsApp will open, and after that, you can tap on ‚Äúmy status‚Äù to post it as your WhatsApp story.* Or you can choose a contact or group to send it to them in chat.Apart from WhatsApp, you‚Äôll also get an option to share on Facebook as well. The Facebook Messenger sharing feature is also there on iOS app for both videos and photos. Only the link with a thumbnail is shared so people will still need to navigate to Instagram to see the actual video. To overcome this issue, you can download the post from Instagram and then send it on WhatsApp.&#x200B;**How To Download And Send Posts From Instagram On WhatsApp**&#x200B;**Android**https://i.redd.it/7wa4d96gj5c21.png1. Install an Instagram downloader app from google play.2. After installing the app, you need to get the link to the Instagram post. For that, you can copy the post link from Instagram.

Then download the post by entering the link into the downloader app.**iPhone**https://i.redd.it/xi0yvnwgj5c21.png1. Download an Instagram downloader from App store.2.

When connected to my home wifi, and i try downloading an image or video sent to me on WhatsApp, it takes about half a minute to start downloading. Once it starts it's pretty quick, but annoying as hell to get it going. When i disable wifi and try doing the same thing over LTE it starts downloading immediately. When connected to wifi networks outside the house, same results as connected to LTE. Every other app and internet activity in general on my phone work seamlessly on the home wifi. Could it be related to ipv6? Has anyone else experienced this?

I use in my smartphoe the app Drivesync to copy every multimedia files from whatsapp to Google Drive and after delete them from my smartphone. This is the way I found to avoid having any picture in my physical smartphone (due to space and security), and still having them available in the cloud. After that I sync all of them with my computer. So I have always access to all of them. My phone is light and no pics are saved there.From that moment they are not anymore available in whatsapp chats, only the thumbs are visible in chat.I realized that when I copy back the multimedia files to the whatsapp folders, they are again completely visible into the exact chat where they were sent/received.So there must be a internal file in the smartphone with the key that relies the name of the file with the chat.Does anybody know how to know the chat knowing the multimedia filename?Thanks!
