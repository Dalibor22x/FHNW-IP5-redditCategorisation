They were tender, honest, but still darkly funny. Some of her pregnancy jokes were pretty old-hat to me, but some of the material was fresh and her delivery was on point. There were glimmers of a great comedian in the special--when she was authentic and real and raw, not just putting herself down reflexively but really exploring stuff she cares about.

It's very concistent and happens about 9 times out of 10. It just kind of cuts out every third word or so during these segments. And ONLY during these segments. I have no audio problem ANY other time. Not during the rest of the show, and not on any other show. It is exclusively on GBBS and has happened on every single episode since I started watching (Currently Collection 5).Also it only does it when I'm streaming to my TV.

Good Hunting: absolutely loved the story. Part of me really liked it cause I'm hyped as hell for Sekiro coming out this week, but I was blown away at how the story transformed. I was expecting some cliche samurai hunt but the transition in time and technology was just brilliant. Loved the characters and the ending. I thought it was the most complete story of them all if that makes any sense. 2. Zima Blue: I saw people talking about this in the main discussion thread and I gotta agree I was absolutely blown away by this and thought it was so cool and philosophical. I purposely stopped my viewing for the night at this episode just to think about it. I still have no clue what the message was, but it seems so deep and relevant to our time anyways. I think this episode deserves a ton of rewatches over the years. 3.

The fight was probably the best out of all of them also (although shapeshifters is so close here, maybe even better, they are all sooo good), and the plot twist was very satisfying.

I liked the different suits and abilities and it was pretty long so I was very satisfied.Most funny: Gotta give it to the yogurt, this was just so random I was dying the whole time, perfect length. alternative histories was kinda funny but got too repetitive even in such a short episode. Worst episode: for me it was the witness. kinda thought it was a cliche mindfuck episode and wasn't really digging the whole random naked chase.

Instead, much like one of its main characters, Rayla, it executes everything excellently right up to the moment when it counts, and then fails miserably.There are three major themes in this this show.The first is physical disabilities and how they neither have to define nor limit your potential if you have the drive. The tripod wolf, the double blind pirate study, Callum’s lack of magical prowess, Rayla’s impending amputation, and Soren’s quadriplegia. Ooooh, we’ll get to that.All of these characters have some severely limiting disability that they need to overcome in order to achieve their dreams, be accepted, or find acceptance within themselves.The second theme is personal struggleAnd this takes a deep dive for a children’s show. We’re dealing with heavy stuff here that’s presented in awesome metaphors for kids. Children rarely receive these kinds of talks in their day to day, but let’s not fool ourselves by thinking they’re somehow protected from the realities of the world. Every character here has daddy-mommy issues of varying severity and this show is trying to be high-fantasy Sesame Street by presenting these difficult topics in a relatable way and show the character’s struggles with them.Rayla has to deal with overt racism and xenophobia, while struggling with her singular identity as an avenging assassin falling apart as she continuously overthinks things and fails. Directly related to that is her being disowned by her people for bucking the party line and questioning dogma. She also hints at estranged parental figures though we have yet to see them. Meanwhile Callum and Ez are struggling with the older-younger brother dynamic (as well as inverted expectations when it comes to succession) while also separately mourning the loss of their father and accepting the burden of taking over a kingdom at a very young age all without the guidance of an adult authority figure. Soren and Claudia are both extremely gifted yet struggling for approval and love from an ambitious and overbearing father figure and are tasked with usurping a throne, committing treason, and betraying their friends.Woof, heavy indeed and touches on all sorts of struggles children regularly face and rarely have an outlet to process through. Well, maybe not that last bit with the treason, but not all metaphors work 1:1.The final theme is “Fuck you, none of it matters” and why I’ve spent the last couple hours ignoring work and angrily typing.Rayla, on the verge of losing her hand to the inevitably tightening friendship bracelet that a medieval lightsaber blessed by the power of the freaking sun couldn’t remove, eventually accepts the loss of her hand as just penance for blind vengeance and a worthy sacrifice for the newfound friendship with Ez and Callum, as well as having found the Dragon Prince, saving him, and being in-process of returning him to avert a world war. Solid trade. Deeply moving. As a blade-wielding, tree climbing acrobatic assassin this will undoubtedly put up major roadblocks for her being a martial master. She’d have to retrain, learn to live with only one hand, or go the route of Hiccup from How to Train Your Dragon and strap on some sort of spikey blade thing to maintain the dual wielding motif. The point is, her identity as a master of her art is about to be shattered and she will have to rebuild and overcome the strugg....FUCK YOU!Deus Ex Dragona to the rescue!The just-hatched puppy lizard Ozzymandingo or whatever, lightly nips off the indestructible festival wrist band and her arm loses the necrotic bluing instantly with no lasting damage. We were nearly confronted with an arc of deep personal loss, reflection, acceptance, and overcoming adversity. Whew, that was a close one!Next, Callum loses his ability to perform magic by smashing the McGuffin that gave him mage powers in order to hatch the dragon egg, the second major (material) sacrifice made for this insufferable lizard. As has been exposited several times over, humans aren’t innately magical and must rely on these rare McGuffins or turn to the allure of the dark side in order to perform ~~bending~~ magic. This was a hugely defining moment for Callum, sacrificing the thing that he’d attached his identity to in order to serve the greater good without hesitation. Does this mean he finds a new calling? Accepts his limitations and learns other skills or becomes a scholar?Fuck You! Deus Ex Hallucina to the rescue!During a fight to save the life of a separate plot dragon from the prince, Callum momentarily turns to the dark side in desperation after learning parseltongue somewhere and collapses from the strain. So begins his spirit quest where he is tempted to accept the dark side by the ghost of Christmas Future, or Ambition Personified, or whatever the hell.But because it’s the dark side he says “No” and is teleported deeper into the mind-fuck where he learns: The Name of the Wind.See now, this bugs me. Nothing about Callum is special, a drum he has been CONSTANTLY banging on, and this is his prime motivator; to find his calling and to BE someone of note in keeping with the expectations of his position as royalty.Callum being not-special makes me feel that any of the dark magic users before him (also not-special humans) were presented with the same choice. Are you telling me that not a single other inquisitive scholar of magic ever said “Wait, hold on, I want to pursue magic this other way first and attempt to harness the elements.”? Not even to test the long-held belief that humans can’t do bending magic? Is there a one-time offer to embrace the dark side and that’s it?Ok whatever, glossing over. He learns The Name of the Wind. Then he wakes up and starts spouting rhetoric about how “everything’s like, connected, man” like someone briefly snapping into lucidity after cresting a particularly big shroom wave three hours into the trip.Now ~~Aang~~ Callum can do ~~air bending~~ storm magic as the first full-fledged human mage. The interruption to this personal arc was a little less jarring as Callum had some time to mope about after losing his power and think. But he didn’t really come to any revelatory enlightenment. He just whined, did the logical thing and reached out to dark magic in order to pursue his ambition and got sucked down the rabbit hole after saying the requisite password, “No”. So I’m still chalking this up to Fuck You because his new powers were just given to him after he tripped balls for a while after listening to hallucinations from his past say “be yourself”. He didn’t do anything or overcome some trial through tenacity or cleverness or a judgement of character. He just tried the next best thing available and said, “That’s a red flag” when his evil twin tried getting him to touch the tesseract. And now. Oh yes, my favorite. Soren’s paralysis and the massive fuck-you-and-choke-on-it the writers left us with.Let’s take a step back and look at Soren’s character for a second. He’s the young knight commander of the king guard. Exceptionally skilled with a blade, arrogant, and a hot head that solves problems with an application of force and tactical cunning. He’s a bit of a dullard, but loveably so and is struggling with arguably the greatest internal conflict of all our characters thus far. His father, Lord Viren has tasked him with killing the inconvenient princes in order to assume the throne. Soren has grown up with them as both friend, mentor, and protector and has expressed no political ambitions and does this only for his father’s approval and love. What a kick in the nuts.After causing the plot dragon to start wrecking shit because he’s dumb, Soren goes to finish the job mano a mano, only to get absolutely destroyed by this thing tail slamming his shit into a boulder. Normally, this is the part of the fight where he stays down for a bit so the camera can focus on the other characters being awesome, but even in the moment I was like, *“damn, that was a pretty serious hit”.* So things happen, whatever. And as Claudia is about to recapture the heroes, Soren calls out to her for help, thus setting the stage for the show’s most poignant moment so far. *Oh wait, this is different, something is…nuh uh, they’re not going there…holy shit they did, he’s actually paralyzed.*What a fantastically executed moment of Greek tragedy bringing hubris low. I forgive everything else up to this point. This scene right here. Soren, the prodigal son, blade master, and vainglorious battle captain has been laid low and there’s no coming back.Shut. Up.I just want to keep living in that moment.Action and reaction, hubris, choice and consequence staring you down hard and not blinking. What a moment!Soren, ever the optimist is brought face to face with the consequences of his actions in a moment of rare introspection and intense self-awareness as he lies confined to a bed rationalizing his actions and new fate. He provoked a dragon to ransack the town whose hospital he is now laid up in and has been paralyzed from the neck down and not even magic can save him. And his first reaction is palpable relief because in his ultimate failure he doesn’t have to choose between a father’s love and killing his best friends. Holy shit, we’re in it here people. Claudia even has a fantastic meltdown where she trashes the room in desperation and rage at coming up against the first true powerlessness she’s ever encountered. It’s some pretty hard-hitting television considering we’re still in children’s show territory.Soren, understanding his new limitations, decides to become a poet. Ok, jarring and silly, but this has been the most serious tone this show has been able to maintain for longer than 5 minutes, let’s get some levity in here and air out the room. So Soren decides he wants to be a bard as his fighting days are behind him. Sure he’s not the most intellectual, but he’s got nothing but extreme privilege by birth and time now, right? Maybe he can play an integral part in the court, or work behind the scenes to reveal what his father is up to, or maybe try to balance the role of loving and supporting son while helping the heroes in secret.While the disparity of his new profession is a little oblique, wow. What an excellent example to show kids that sometimes, really bad and permanent things can happen to anyone and those consequences are for keeps. In real life, it’s not always “somebody else” this happens to. But life doesn’t just end there. The world keeps on spinning whether you’re on it or not. Life might be off track, destiny might be changed, but you can still find meaning and positivity and be a good person. Real life is brutal and oftentimes uncaring but redemption is there for any who seek it.*deep inhale*FUCK YOU RIGHT IN YOUR STUPID LITTLE EYE!DEUS. EX. MAGICA COCKSUCKERS!Claudia suddenly remembers how to fix things, goes out, presumably kills a fawn for the power of innocence, and comes back with her magic hands and fixes Soren’s spine. &#x200B;There I said it. He’s all better now. Go back to your regularly scheduled show. The magic is gone and nothing means anything anymore. There are no consequences, nihilism reigns supreme.Fuck you, your hopes and dreams, and the horse you rode in on. And you’ll like it. Oh you’ll gobble it up, won’t you? Because the dragon is a *puppy* and has *Disney eyes* and makes puppy noises and it's just. so. cute! And the toad is a puppy but he’s grumpy-gus. Oh, oh, and Callum and Rayla? Will they? Won’t they? She almost said it, the word. You know she was going to, right before Callum woke up. Oh the suspense, whatever will happen? Can’t wait for them to get to the land of elves and have the roles reversed. Oh do you think Rayla’s parents will accept her and Callum? Because you know it’s going to happen, oh yes you do.And just like that, season two ends with Claudia and Soren hobbling back home because she forgot to heal his stupid broken ribs.I’m so angry about this and I don’t know why. Maybe it’s just my love of fantasy and subverting norms and hoping the writer of Avatar, the greatest cartoon ever created, could come up with something special. Every time this show has had a chance to be something more, to teach a really valuable and deep truth, it backs away at the last second, tells an awkward stupid joke to break the tension, pats us on the back and we breathe a sigh of relief as our expectations are neatly and gently laid back on the tracks and the plot chugs on uninterrupted, nervously glancing around to make sure no one noticed that something profound almost happened.Whew. Close call friends, we almost learned something. Miss me with that.";True;The Dragon Prince is hot garbage, here's 2,200 words explaining why.

Most episodes had very little in terms of plot (even for shorts).2. Most episodes felt like trailers for indie computer games, some felt like trailers for indie smartphone games both animation and story wise.3. When there was plot it was super predictable and repeating, some episodes felt like they were entirely written by 1 person who has done this for the first time.But most importantly what really prompted me to write this thread is reading an article where the creators seemed to be proud of the fact that this is an ""adult"" cartoon. Which I found bizzare.There's an episode about profanity yelling bad-ass man fighting off a zombie Dracula. There's an episode about WW2 tough Russians fighting off demonic monsters. There's an episode about rednecks fighting of invaders from space.Yes, this stuff contains a lot of nudity, violence and profanity. But that's exactly why it felt like a non-adult cartoon but rather something I'd love to have watched when 10-12. My favorite movie as a child was 300. Precisely because of all the blood and violence, and lack of dialogue and hard to understand plot. Because that's what makes something adult. Not bobbies and blood. The boring parts. Most episodes in this show felt exactly like something I'd totally dig as a 10 year old and that's exactly why I didn't like them too much. Yogurt would probably be the exception though I disliked that one for different reason.**This isn't what makes an ""adult"" show, dear creators.**To end this: I loved the episode ""good hunting"", so as an attempt not to get downvoted to hell I'll also review why.- It is story dense, time isn't wasted on unnecessary things but rather every bit of violence and dialogue is necessary to further the story, the short form is therefore very well used and I felt attachment to the main characters.- Whilst the beginning of the story is quite cliche (if Chinese cinema is considered), it develops into something very unexpected. It is beautiful and tragic through and through. Every development was unprecedented and it all feels like something I'd really love to be made into a feature film or a standalone show.  - There's no forced violence, no forced romance, no forced environmentalism, and no forced girl power, even though this would've been a very good opportunity, but having it come naturally felt far more mature as it makes you think about those things on a deeper level that way.";True;"Violence, profanity and nudity do not make an ""adult show"" [Love, Death & Robots Spoilers]";https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/b3cjhf/violence_profanity_and_nudity_do_not_make_an/

Then I watched the final episode where we seemed to get a hollywood ending which I expected and actually hoped for because I really liked the characters and the dynamic between them who reminded me a bit of my time as a student.Then came the real ending at the last 20 seconds, who came up with such a shitty ending? Literally the whole series was for nought. I can get that they wanted to show the power of the order or something like that but that ending destroyed everything the characters worked for and the relationships they built.Reason I liked this series was mainly because I liked the characters and their interactions but that ending just took that chewed it up and didn't even spit it back in some mangled form, instead it made it dissapear which actually made the whole show pointless.Really whoever thought of that ending doesn't deserve working on another tv-show.Anyway I wanted to rant a bit and ask you guys what you thought of the show. ;False;Just finished The Order;https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/b20g2e/just_finished_the_order/

For example; After first 2 or 3 episodes, I can figure it out the ending or at least how the characters will be proceeding into the future episodes. But there are some issues with it. A character whom is in the starring of the serie or becomes more into centre of the serie could trust a person he or she just met a week ago more that his or her family member. I mean if I was in this situation and hated that family member, I would at least consider if the saying is true or not. I would be not instantly block them. I say this because the shows from USA was and is full of messages about feelings, being together, we are stronger when we are together, you are the best of who you are when you know who you really are, etc. in recent years and the making the character so idiotic that can’t reach small bit of reasonable reaction at the situations. It might be because of poor explanation of the story or acting but this is why I stopped watching the serie and start to avoid some of the serie which gave me this feeling in first couple episodes. So have you ever notice something like this or have a problem which somewhat related to this subject?

This setup worked well for many, many years. Then last year, we started to get stuttering of the image during certain shows. Popular movies seemed to stream OK, but shows that were maybe not as widely viewed would stutter every 1 or 2 minutes for about 2-5 seconds before resuming – frustrating in the extreme.Reading the posts on various sites, all sorts of recommendations were given, but the basic premise was that the problem was on your end, not Netflix’s. And I believed this, but could not figure out what the problem was, because none of the solutions proposed by people worked.Late last year we subscribed to Amazon Prime, running its video service app on the exact same hardware and network as the Netflix app, and voila, no problems whatsoever. All 1080P content played with no delays loading and no stuttering at any point on anything we watched. We couldn’t believe it.I had a theory that the capacity of Netflix’s server farms had been reached, but then I contacted Netflix support directly and tried to get some idea from them as to what was going on. As would be expected, the support person tried to shift the focus to issues with my hardware and network, but I kept bringing up the fact that Amazon was OK all around, and even many Netflix popular items were fine, so how could there be such intermittent hardware/network issues? Finally, they gave up on that route, and brought up the content itself, and how sometimes the uploading of it was not done correctly. And that there was a way to report such problems to Netflix. I mean come on – a hugely popular service from a multi-billion dollar company like Netflix and they don’t have quality control in place to ensure the content is properly uploaded (is that even possible nowadays with modern networks and protocols). It’s hard to believe someone would actually propose such nonsense, but there you go.So now, I’m back to lack of capacity in their server farms. I cannot believe Netflix would actually allow corrupted content to be uploaded into their network – the idea is preposterous and I think serves as a fig leaf. Probably what they have is a list of shows that are very popular and are given top priority on their servers for distribution. And less popular shows are given lower priority, and may at times suffer delays getting out the pipe because their servers can’t handle the load. If you report such items, I’m guessing what really happens is the priority for the stuttering item is increased on the servers so it suffers fewer delays, and NOT that a corrupt version is replaced (again, the idea that a major service provider would allow that is totally ludicrous).And the cherry on top? They now want to bump up the subscription by $2/month. Some people on the forums have been screaming Netflix would never do anything to diminish a user’s experience. The fact that they need $2 more per month from you should put the lie to that – they are prioritizing traffic on the server because they have no choice due to insufficient capital to invest in infrastructure – the spending priority is on content.At this point I am inclined to cancel my subscription, unless someone has a solid explanation (and solution) for the stuttering (and is not just pulling guesses out of their ass).;False;Netflix not spending enough on infrastructure in Canada;https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/b14915/netflix_not_spending_enough_on_infrastructure_in/

First, the new grand magus vera, she looks at the vaede macum for a second, touching it. This could mean LITERALLY ANYTHING, and is so open to interpretation. Does she want it? Is she reflecting on what happened? Is she ashamed she didnt do more to prevent it? Second, silverback shouldnt be in the show still.

Silverback and jack had no connection, and the hides might as well have had no name. Im pretty sure pouring magical tears onto a book, setting it on fire, should kill him.

Jack's last line was ""who am i?"" Which could mean that his entire memory is gone. Does he remember that him and his grandfather were trying to kill edward? Does he remember he goes to belgrave university? Does he remember the knights? All of the knights still have the hides, so how will that affect them?

I saw Black Earth Rising first on Netflix. John Goodman is exceptional in it and you can almost feel the emotions that Michaela Coel is going through in that series. On the other hand, the Widow on Amazon prime is a Kate Beckinsale affair. She is front and center in it as a woman in search of answers.&#x200B;In the end, Black Earth Rising has a twist that you can see from a mile away. The acting is pretty breath taking and the way that BBC2 stayed away from gratuitous violence and relied instead on stop motion animation was very very cool. It's less of a thriller and more of a drama series but it needs a ton of viewing investment. It doesn't quite follow the same breakneck pace that the Bodyguard lures you into (the only commonality was that they're both BBC2). The ending was somewhat expected and it provided a fair amount of closure, doesn't feel like they need a Season 2. Right at the center of everything is a mining operation and surprise surprise, getting paid. It is a biting take into the Rwandan genocide and the conflict between the Hutus and the Tutsis, the people who lived through it and an attempt to right wrongs of the past.&#x200B;The Widow is a far inferior offering in terms of  the plot, the story and the acting. Kate Beckinsale delivers a pretty convincing portrayal of a woman wronged and on the search for answers in the Congo. Her husband, presumed dead in an air crash is found wearing what must be the only orange cap in all of Congo when firefights break out in Kinshasa. Kate Beckinsale finds out a way to rewind live TV in a hospital waiting room and then corrals her will to find her dead husband Will. 6 episodes later, it turns out that not only is he alive but actually quite ....happy without Kate B in his life. She manages to transplant a child soldier, gets her friend killed in episode 2 and abducts an innocent high schooler to find her husband who, as we have covered....is actually quite happy without her. In other words, this show is pretty forgettable.

I stuck it out to the end despite not liking it because my friend recommended it highly, and I was also curious to see the Bloody Tears scene people were talking about.But the best that can be said for the show is that it has some cool fight scenes. Overall, it's just... boring. I literally felt sleepy while watching it. It's like someone took a promising premise and just sprinkled sleep powder all over it. Outside of the climatic fights, nothing much happens in the show. Literally half of season 2 is spent on some vampires arguing about whether to betray Dracula or not, and there's no reason to care.This would be ok if the character drama was actually interesting, but it is too thin and shallow to hold the audience's attention. I gave Umbrella Academy flak for drawing things out, but at least UA was consistently entertaining, even in The Day That Wasn't.

Castlevania seems like the kind of show I would like, which makes it all the more surprising that I ended up hating it.

Negatives -First of all the CGI: It is awful, a lot of times when i was starting to get immersed in the story bam a power that looks like a fan made special effects, i can't believe netflix with all the money they have can put this piece of sh*t of special effects, dont f*cking rush a show if your special effects look like i can download them from an app store-If you want to make a serious show and add comedy don't mash them together in the same moment, it really makes the story weak and looses the investment you have in a scene (the only scene i can think they did both well is when the ice cream truck comes) -Music: i read a comment on another umbrella academy thread that described it perfectly,	""the music was really hit or miss, when they hit it, it was really good, but when they miss it it was really bad"" -Delayed plot: If the apocalypse is in 3 days and the characters are literally doing nothing its bad writting, you should learn from Castlevania, even though season 2 kinda had this moments you didn't notice that badly but the first season did it perfectly, a 4 episode season that doesn't delay the plot and doesn't put random dance scenes or amma fuck a furry scene just because we need more time. -Do you know there is something called technology that allows you to comunicate by a cellphone or computer? Why a celebrity doesn't have a phone, why a police officer has to use a motels phone to to contact someone? If your show consist on timelines and going to the past, if you are in 2019 and cant text or make a cellphone call  you are not in 2019.There are more negative points but for me those are the worst ones. Positives-You build an interesting universe that has a lot of potential but you dont do anything with it, i know you want a 10 season series but if you cant get to season 2 without explaining just enough about everything you are doing a bad job, you had the other kids and the commission and you didn't explain anything about them. -Fives: i thought it was going to be badly executed but you kinda nailed him, just some moments felt a little off but in general really good. -I really enjoyed the seeing what would happen if everyone gave up and i think it was one of the strongest build ups for the other half of the show but you just wasted it by not continuing using the momentum you built. -I really enjoyed the intro you had, just using the environment without actually having a 3 minute song introducing what i am watching there was just one of the intros that felt really forced. Recommendations -Don't force a plot or drag it out to the point i just want to skip it-Build more on character arcs without relaying on memorie sequences -The characters dont seem to feel anything, a character cant go crying and minutes later appear like nothing has happened -Decide what you want to focus on, i can't watch someone getting trapped in a place and suffer almost a mental breakdown and the next scene someone having a margarita enjoying the thought of finally stopping the apocalypse. Final thoughtsAfter finally finishing the season and kinda want to see the direction they will take season 2 i just really hope they expand on the universe and explain more things, i just dont want to see another dancing scene where i just skip it because it is unnecessary.

In order to cancel the right shows, Netflix would actually have to know our preferences. Fact is, Netflix has absolutely no clue how much I love Lovesick, Detectorists, Campus, Spaced, The Almighty Johnsons, The Sound of Your Heart, The League, One-Punch Man, Person of Interest, Sense8 or How To Grow A Planet.Of course I gave all these shows a thumbs up. However, it isn't even a small sacrifice to click a thumbs up button, which is exactly why doing so doesn't reveal the size of my love for these shows. Love is a function of sacrifice.>If a woman told us that she loved flowers, and we saw that she forgot to water them, we would not believe in her “love” for flowers. Love is the active concern for the life and the growth of that which we love. Where this active concern is lacking, there is no love.— Erich Fromm, The Art of LovingImagine if, all else being equal, we could ""earmark"" our own subscription dollars to the content that we love. A dollar that I spend on Lovesick is a dollar that I can't spend on Campus. Ouch. I'd have to seriously prioritize, and doing so would be seriously painful. But this painful prioritization process is the only way that Netflix, and content creators, can actually know my true preferences.The same goes for Wired.Let us, the consumers, use our cash to cultivate/curate the content that we're crazy about.>Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer. - Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations";False;Netflix Cancels The Wrong Shows;https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/ax312u/netflix_cancels_the_wrong_shows/

This email was one which was compromised a couple years back and the details pasted on various pastebins ever since. I had forgotten I had even ever signed up to Netflix with this account and the plan would have lapsed years ago along with any associated credit cards but the password must have been the compromised old one I used years ago.

Yesterday someone in China changed my email address linked to my account. Netflix sent me an email notifying me of the change and I would no longer be able to use that email when logging in. Now this is where most emails would have a link for help if it was not you who changed it. They do have that link but you have to enter your email linked to your account but the only person that knows that is in China. So I called Netflix and the only way they can help is if I provide the last 8 digits of the card they have on file. Problem is the card they have on file is not my current one, it’s a closed out card from 6 years ago and I don’t have it anymore. Now Netflix is obviously still getting paid so I’m sure they must have more bank related info other than a card number that doesn’t work. Still they said that’s the only way to access my account and my only other option is to cancel, losing all my shows on my list and what not is a huge inconvenience but whatever. My last option is to see if I can get the old card number from my bank tomorrow.Anyway thanks 🙏🏻 to the low life in China who hacked my Netflix, 8$ a month must be a huge score for you.;False;China hacker basically forcing me to cancel Netflix.;https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/auchgs/china_hacker_basically_forcing_me_to_cancel/

While the credits, now minuscule in the top corner are pushed away. I actually would have to RE select the screen I was already watching, just to view the credits.Further more, I find the whole Big mouth series a bit abrasive, as is the art (obviously personal opinion as I’m sure it’s popular)I feel it is a little presumptuous and ignorant of Netflix, to diminish the credit to the people who created this movie. As I’m sure the Director, who was the only name I was able to glimpse before becoming microscopic, would feel that all those hundreds of people deserve credit where it is due.Is there some way to turn off this marketing or am I forced to have to remain vigilant at the end of each viewing to ensure I get to see these things?Also, you don’t even get a choice on viewing the trailer. You have 20 seconds and then it automatically plays. I would have to actually cancel out of that screen to avoid it.Maybe some people don’t care but I actually do often take the time to view the credits and I feel it is due to these creative folks who enrich our lives or provide diversions in this crazy world.Frankly if I had content on this service, I would be speaking to someone. **Edit** I feel it is also important to note, that if you actually choose to go back and watch the credits after the trailer drops, you’ll notice that the movie starts fresh.

Last 2 episodes seemed disconnected imo from reality, first, Timothy and Darren win with a clusterfuck of an omelette that DEFINITELY shouldn't have won; mixing all of those salty meats is either a beginner's mistake or something a 200 lb american would enjoy, not a world renowed french chef that seemed pretty picky about strong flavours. Charles and Rodrigo didn't have a great presentation like before but it was way better than that pointless caviar flawed omelette. And I think everyone can agree with the fact that the safe dish from Timothy was a slap in the face to what the contest represents, to all the other chef's hard work and the viewers that were promptly expecting something new out of this show. The dish was unimaginative, bland and looked ok, not great, just ok. To say that just because it was prepared well it belongs with the other dishes, is just disrespectful to those dishes. If he had made the best scrambled eggs in the world, they would be laughing at him, yet, the other chef's that were creative and poured their hearts and soul into making a truly deserving of praise dish, got nothing; the other dishes had flaws that could've been fixed with a few tweaks and would've been a far better dish than the one that won.

Especially cartoons. I personally prefer to watch everything in it's original audio, and if it's English, I also like to watch it with English subtitles. So when I'm watching something live action, I hit play and that's what's set to default: English audio with English subtitles.I never watched many cartoons, and the ones I did before, I had no problem with the default language configurations. But when I recently started watching Avatar, every time I start an episode, it starts with Portuguese audio. So I go and change it to English and watch the episode normally, but when I start the next one, it's back to Portuguese. Shouldn't Netflix understand that, once I change my audio and subtitles preference for a TV show, I want all the following episodes to stay that way? It has no reason to keep changing the language to Portuguese, it only assumes that's what I want based on my location. But even my profile is set to English, everything is in English when I navigate the app.I wonder if anyone here has had this problem, and if someone might know how to fix it.;False;Netflix annoyingly assumes I want to watch dubbed cartoons;https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/arpi2w/netflix_annoyingly_assumes_i_want_to_watch_dubbed/
